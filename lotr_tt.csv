","Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.",/review/rw2294579/?ref_=tt_urv

4,25 March 2003,tfrizzell,," They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.
","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0586308/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!",/review/rw1042496/?ref_=tt_urv

","I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.

If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas .

","From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",/review/rw0988588/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.",/review/rw1306916/?ref_=tt_urv

Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render.

","The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end.

If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them.

However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short.  Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players.  We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures.  Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's  more intimate look at the characters.  This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement.

","Really, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down.  Jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff with Aragorn.  I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I was not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and adding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch.  But what was the purpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff?  Creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience?  Screen time for Liv Tyler? All it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes.  This crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release.  the movie would have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle of Helms Deep.",/review/rw0586706/?ref_=tt_urv

51,8 January 2023,nickenchuggets,10," Fighting for the good in the world
","Because Lord of the Rings is arguably the most acclaimed movie trilogy of all time, you should not need to read a lot of (if any) reviews on this film to know that it is amazing. In my view, I think it's even better than the first, since the enormous landscapes of Tolkien's fantasy world are shown onscreen to even better effect here. Huge environments, memorable characters, and beautiful scenery are just things that complement a great story, so let's see if The Two Towers can live up to the iconic status of its prequel. The plot in this film is quite an undertaking to explain, as it follows three separate (but concurrent) storylines. The first involves Frodo Baggins and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin respectively), the two Hobbits from the first movie, as they continue their journey towards the evil realm of Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring. The second involves two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, attempting to stage an attack on Isengard, a fortress under the command of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). Finally, the last arc has to do with Legolas, Aragorn, and a few other warriors as they try to protect the kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's huge army of Orcs. We first see Frodo and Sam lost in the wilderness of Gondor. Gollum, a hideously malformed former hobbit who was physically corrupted by the One Ring, tries to attack Frodo because he wants the ring for himself. Only heard or otherwise alluded to in the first film, Gollum (formerly known as Smeagol) essentially serves as Frodo's guide to Mordor. While Sam vocalizes his thoughts that Gollum is a pitiful creature who should just be killed, Frodo feels bad for what the ring did to him and allows him to lead the way. Not to mention, only he knows about the secret passageways leading into Mordor. Meanwhile, Legolas and Aragorn (Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen respectively) enlist the help of the dwarf axeman Gimli as they try to save Merry and Pippin from a group of orcs. The orcs loot, burn and massacre scores of villages, but they are assaulted by a group of Rohan horse riding soldiers (known as Rohirrim), which allows Merry and Pippin to escape into a forest. After trekking further into Rohan, Aragorn and the others come to the lair of Theoden, Rohan's king, who has been corrupted by Saruman's influence. Some time later in the woods, the group are nearly blinded by the appearance of a very bright light, which turns out to be none other than Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Presumed dead after fighting a large demonic entity known as a Balrog in the last film, he actually managed to slay the beast after it dragged him deep into the Mines of Moria. Gandalf and the others go back to Theoden, and the former uses his staff to free him of Saruman's mind control. As a gesture of goodwill, Theoden sends his niece, Eowyn, to go with them as they evacuate Rohan in order to confront the orcs. A large battle ensues after refugees from Rohan are ambushed by orcs, and in the carnage, Aragorn is knocked off a cliff and apparently killed. In the mystical Elvish realm of Rivendell, it is said that Aragorn won't be coming back, and even if he did, he has a pitifully short lifespan compared to elves. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) makes the promise to defend humankind with the lives of elf warriors if necessary. She sends a large contingent of soldiers to the fortress of Helm's Deep, which is now in Saruman's sights. While all this is happening, Merry and Pippin are found in the forest by Treebeard, a giant sentient tree who is able to move around. Treebeard just so happens to be the leader of the Ent, a race of sentient trees. The two hobbits try to convince him to do what he can in order to stop Saruman's orc army, but he insists on consulting his ""council"" first. Aragorn is later found by a horse at the bottom of the cliff and brought to Helm's Deep. As he, Legolas, and the others arrive, they take up defensive positions just as the Uruk-hai (orc) army comes crashing down on them. Although the elves Galadriel sent are impeccable archers, the horde they are opposing seems without end. The orcs eventually breach the fortress and overwhelm the defenders. Just when all seems lost, Gandalf, leading a huge formation of Rohan cavalry, arrives and tears through the orcish attackers. At the same time, Treebeard, who has been carrying Merry and Pippin towards Isengard, sees a large deforested area where many of his friends used to live. Infuriated, he calls on all the Ent throughout the entire forest to join him as he attacks Saruman's tower. As the Ent and Gandalf's horsemen punish the remaining orcs, Gollum leads Frodo and Sam through swamps in order to infiltrate Mordor through its main gate. However, they are taken prisoner by Faramir, brother of the dead Baromir (Sean Bean) from the first film. They are taken to Gondor, where Sam and Frodo try to explain to Faramir that his brother is dead because the ring claimed his sanity for its own wicked amusement. As Gondor comes under attack, Frodo's mind seems to slip into the ring's influence, and he doesn't appear to be in control of himself. A Ringwraith nearly kills him, but he is rescued by Sam. Faramir eventually lets Frodo and Sam get away, and Gollum continues to lead them to their objective. Little do the boys realize, Gollum is secretly plotting to take the ring back from them. Once again, Peter Jackson demonstrates that he is one of the best directors of all time. There's so much to love about Lord of the Rings. Like I said before, I think this movie is a great improvement over the first (despite the fact that Sean Bean isn't in it). The music, special effects, and just about everything else has been refined to basically perfection. Gollum has become a favorite among fans of the series, and even almost 20 years later, you can still barely tell he's only CGI. While Frodo didn't appear as much as I would have liked, the quality of the other storylines more than makes up for this. All the characters are likeable, even the ones you're not meant to like. It was a real treat to see the Helm's Deep battle towards the end, since it really did look hopeless for those opposing Saruman. By the way, I kind of knew that they weren't going to let Gandalf disappear from this series, as he's one of the best things about it. The scene in the beginning in which he fights the balrog and we learn what really happened to him after his supposed death is still one of the best starts to a movie I've seen yet. Overall, I would definitely say The Two Towers is better than the first film of this incredible trilogy, but all of them are usually regarded as works of genius for a reason.",/review/rw8786267/?ref_=tt_urv

","This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible.

Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations.

Once again, the overall film was well crafted and well directed much like it's previous. The humor was also exceptionally better as well. Let us not forget the Ents also.

","The second part in the Lord of the Rings installment is a great masterpiece. In fact, all three movies are masterpieces. I believe that this film is slightly better than the first one. In the Two Towers, Frodo and Sam are being led to Mordor by the beast, Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hunting Merry and Pippin, are involved getting Theoden of Rohan away from Saruman's control, and fighting Saruman's Orcs. Gandalf is better than ever in this film. He is not dead as we all assumed. Gollum is great in this film. Andy Serkis should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The CGI is amazing, so amazing it makes Gollum appear life-like. I liked Treebeard in this film. He serves as a mentor to Merry and Pippin. I liked the chemistry between Legolas and Gimli. They provide comedy in perilous times of Middle Earth. The acting is excellent especially Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen. Howard Shore continues with his captivating music. The effects, especially the visual effects are great. This is truly an epic. The whole theater was on it's feet doing a standing ovation when the end credits rolled along. If you haven't already, see the Return of the King. I rate this movie 10/10.",/review/rw1973076/?ref_=tt_urv
88,15 December 2013,ironhorse_iv,8," Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is so precious, but gees, it's a hard film to get through.
","Don't get me wrong, Director Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's films are all well-done films, but the pacing of these films are just way too slow. Even with Two Towers being the shortest of the three films, 179 minutes is a very long time, to sit down and watch a film. By the time, you get to the end of the film, you just witness, a lot of things happen on screen, but not much, if that make sense. A lot of things could be cut down, in the editing room, even more. It's like being in the middle of a mile run. You glad you went this far, but it's not done yet, you got another half mile and you're starting to feel a bit tired. Since, this film is the middle of the trilogy, there is no beginning nor end, for that, reason, it's hard to say if the movie is great or just OK. In my opinion, The Two Towers is just alright. The Two Towers is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. It is book III: The Treason of Isengard and IV: The Journey to Mordor AKA the Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East in the book series. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers arguably contains the most book to film major alterations, but the movie mostly follows the books, very close, mixing the two, but unlike the book starts, the movie starts a little bit later as 2001's Fellowship took the first chapter of this book opening as its ending. Instead, we get a cool new intro with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) fighting the Balrog monster from the last movie. We come into the film, after the break down of the fellowship, with smaller groups of characters going on their own adventures and story arches intercut with each other. Frodo (Elijah Woods) & Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey and meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the way. Gollum is the best new character, they introduce into this film. Andy Serkis is amazing actor, and he puts out the best motion CGI capture acting, I ever saw. Since, there was a decision to leave Shelob for the third movie meant that Faramir (David Wenham) had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam's journey. This change was indeed different than the book. It does add conflict, but gees... it slows the plot down. Frodo is the everyman character, because he lack power, he is the best one to carry the ring throughout the film. His real challenge is to bear the ring without giving in to its temptations. This resistance is Frodo's inner journey, in which his pure heart is constantly under assault by his darker yearnings for power. It had some pretty powerful symbolism here between Faramir, Frodo, Sam and Gollum. I do have a problem with Frodo & Sam's friendship. I have nothing against gays, but there is a huge different between friendship and being in love. It's obvious Tolkien wanted to show the strength of friendship, so I don't think it was intentional, but it's still hard to ignore that it comes off as a gay relationship. While this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) find themselves fighting the Orcs invasion at Helm's Deep and helping the war-torn nation of Rohan. While in the book, Helm's Deep is a small battle. In this film, it's the big climax of the film. It's one of the best battle scenes in film, I ever witnessed. I can do without the small awful cheesy things, like the heroes mowing down hundreds of Orcs without much battle scars. I can do without Legolas being too perfect like, shield surfing and only speak in exposition. I couldn't stand Gimli being pull into too much comedy relief role. Also, glad to see Arwen (Liv Tyler) was not in the battle scenes in the final version, as they film her earlier in it fighting alongside Aragorn. I can still do without Aragorn's life is now tied to the Fate of the Ring bit. It makes little to no sense. I understand that they (the producers) were trying to make anti-ring symbol with her character as a sign of hope, but it doesn't work. The movie is more about Aragon rise to become king and presented a coming to age story for males. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) end up encountering the giant treelike Ents and trying to stop Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army at Isengard. Environment themes are question here. Still, the whole Treebeard part were a bit boring. One thing, I hate about Lord of the Rings are the cheap fake out deaths scenes. Aragorn, Frodo, and others. As much as I love seeing Gandalf again, his death scene in the last movie was supposed to be impactful. For him, to come back makes it seem like you can cheat death here. I blame it on Tolkien. I didn't like the whole Jesus Christ metaphor with his character. Besides Boromir (Sean Bean), does any main character dies in this movie. The movie lose a bit of its sense of danger without any major deaths. Everybody seems nearly invincible. Water seems to be a symbol of rebirth in this film. Gandalf, Aragorn, and Frodo were save by large bodies of water. Similarly, Saruman's tower loses its power when its plain is flooded. Like a baptized, it's free from sin. Even the elves depart Middle-earth on a boat and sail out to a great body of water. The film has a lot of Christianity themes. The music by Howard Shore is amazing. Overall: Good visual film that can be a bit confusing. Just hard to get through all the themes, and all the characters arches.",/review/rw2922195/?ref_=tt_urv

These are truly labors of love, every aspect of these films are crafted with exquisite care, it is obvious that all the people involved, from the producers, actors and directors on down wanted to spare no effort to pay full homage to Tolkien's classic works. There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here. And, just as with the first, the sheer amount of detail, the vastness of the story, is almost overwhelming, these clearly are movies that can be seen many times because there's so much to be absorbed.

Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of ""The Lord of the Rings"" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here.

96,13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,7," ""Stupid, fat hobbit.""
","I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away.

The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films).

",This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well.

So let's save Gandolf first who shifts from The Grey to The White, from powerless to finally magical. The details are all accounted for in the DVD. Then the two hobbits that were captured and thought dead were only prisoners and they will manage to escape and even win the battle of the film, without anyone knowing it really. They will make friends with tree-herders and they will lead the forest against the bad wizard in his tower. And then the trio man-elf-dwarf will liberate some king in some city from the power of some middle man of a wizard and lead his people and troops to a mountain citadel, and this same man and same elf and same dwarf will have the surprise to see the king of the elves and his army arrive to reinforce the humans against the orcs. Some kind of slow growing seeds of courage and commitment. Some call that love too. And the battle will start, spectacular and grandiose, and many will die on both sides and the final salvaging reinforcements will arrive under the authority of Gandolf The White. The orcs will be defeated. During that time the two lost hobbits and the tree-herders will start a tree war against the malicious bad wizard in his tower with his mine and giant smithy underground at the foot of his mausoleum-spire that had provided the army of orcs with all kinds of arms, weapons and armours. And it will all go drowned and soaked, overflowed and flooded. That's how a battle is won, with some courage not to feel pain, with a lot of luck not to hear the warnings of Ms Caution, Miss Prudence and Mrs Carefulness, the three witches of passivity, and a fair dose of blindness not to see danger. And here we are with a long film for a young audience, though the audience of the first film must have aged a little and the film is becoming a lot more human. We even have several heterosexual kisses along with quite a few man-to-man embraces. Going on that way we may have a couple of weddings at the end of the third episode. And it all ends with two hobbits raiding the cellar and kitchen of the bad gloomy dangerous vicious wizard and we even find that funny, even if we are slightly worried for their waistlines. And the real end of course comes with the declaration of total trust from Sam the hobbit gardener who guards no one but cultivates friendship and Frodon the hobbit adventurer guardian of the ring and carrier of its powers to the final destruction site somewhere in hell.

He is a Ranger, a dying out category of peacemakers and justice executioners, just like Roland is a Gunslinger. But still, and that is going to last till the end I imagine, no bridge or door from this medieval fantasy world to our modern world and it is a shame.

The first LoTR film's finale lacks and the travel time during the film tiptoes into Hobbit movie territory. The third LoTR film suffers from being a wannabe Two Towers; it has like three different battles that have zero tension with zero build up. Plus those stupid green ghosts act like an easy solution to the problem. Just like the giant eagle tropism. Ironically enough, Two Towers is the only LoTR film without giant eagles.

Then we watch Sam and Frodo have the same conversation over and over and over again: 'Oh, Sam, I can't go on.' 'It's the ring, Mr Frodo, I know!' Oh, and now they have this creepy character called Gollum that follows them around and is supposed to be entertaining, but comes across as irritating. For some reason Sam still calls Frodo 'Mr'. Oh, then some boring talking trees show up and bore to death even the characters themselves. What chance does the audience stand? Finally we get to the climax and the grand battle. Except Jackson doesn't know how to direct it. The tone wavers. It goes between terror (women and children expecting to be slaughtered) to comedy with Gimli and Legolas. And then he keeps interrupting the battle in order to cut to those boring bits with the talking trees. He even adds slow motion in the battle scenes for no good reason. The end result is that there is no rhythm to the battle and the emotion is dissipated. There you have it. Lots of noise and CGI, and no emotion - apart from boredom.",/review/rw3192702/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created.

128,27 January 2003,rosscinema,7," Impressive looking
","This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better.",/review/rw0586095/?ref_=tt_urv

","In a totally fictitious Middle Ages, peopled by men, elves,monsters, dwarfs, moving trees and other more or less strange beings, another episode of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil unfolds itself in a succession of fantasy and dream sceneries where terror and poetry combine in a fantastic symbiosis. On the other hand some dialogues and monologues as well as some characters reach an almost Shakespearean grandeur. This movie has some images of rare beauty and some others which fill us with awe and wonder. And what about the story? Well the story is the weakest part of all this with the usual plot flaws and a lot of unlikely facilities in the outcome of certain plot scenes about which I will not dwell now to avoid being a spoiler. But who cares after all? The usual spectator of this kind of movies only wants to be recreated during the projection time and devoted to all the emotions that the various incidents produce in his mind. It's therefore intrinsically one more movie aimed at entertaining the spectator and not at making him think or at conveying any message beyond the simple one according to which Good must always triumph over Evil.",/review/rw0585939/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting, once again, was phenomenal. The comic relief, even though it appears in the midst of serious dilemmas, is still really funny, and well done. The tension comes and goes when it is needed, and when it is necessary. The camera work is great, and the final battle scene is just super epic! You know a battle scene is good when it lasts half an hour and you don't get bored of it.

","Because this one was built on the foundations of the first one. And it used that advantage to show all the epicism of the Tolkien story. A non-stop story (with the only exception being a sequence to reinforce Aragorn's love story). The scenes either advanced the plot at a brisk pace or were action sequences (that also advanced the plot in one way or another). There's not a lot of character development and that's not a fault. The story and characters remain PG, therefore complexity and nuance storytelling aren't the focus (there is a tiny bit more of light politics with the realms and their conflicts though).",/review/rw5726113/?ref_=tt_urv

","Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added.

Along the way, friendships grow and more evolve in the most unlikely places. There is plenty of humor, sadness, action, and fantasy in this film.

","Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister.

Picking one above the others can be difficult, but The Two Towers rises to the top because of its final battle. The moment the rain falls over the hushed armies in the last minutes before the conflict erupts is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a war epic. The overwhelming hopelessness of the remnant of Rohan as they attempt to survive the endless enemy hordes is incredibly powerful, and the tension is tangible. Despite knowing a third movie comes next, it felts as if anything could happen.
