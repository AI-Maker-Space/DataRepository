            <span class="ts-text">The following is a conversation with Elon Musk, DJ Seo, Matthew MacDougall, Bliss Chapman, and Noland Arbaugh about Neuralink and the future of humanity. Elon, DJ, Matthew and Bliss are of course part of the amazing Neuralink team, and Noland is the first human to have a Neuralink device implanted in his brain. I speak with each of them individually, so use timestamps to jump around, or as I recommend, go hardcore, and listen to the whole thing. This is the longest podcast I&#8217;ve ever done. It&#8217;s a fascinating, super technical, and wide-ranging conversation, and I loved every minute of it. And now, dear friends, here&#8217;s Elon Musk, his fifth time on this, the Lex Fridman podcast,</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It depends somewhat on the regulatory approval, the rate at which we get regulatory approvals. So, we&#8217;re hoping to do 10 by the end of this year, total of 10. So, eight more.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah. I think it&#8217;s obviously going to get better with each one. I don&#8217;t want to jinx it, but it seems to have gone extremely well with the second implant. So, there&#8217;s a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It&#8217;s working very well.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">In years, it&#8217;s going to be gigantic, because we&#8217;ll increase the number of electrodes dramatically. We&#8217;ll improve the signal processing. So, even with only roughly, I don&#8217;t know, 10, 15% of the electrodes working with Noland, with our first patient, we were able to get to achieve a bit per second. That&#8217;s twice the world record. So, I think we&#8217;ll start vastly exceeding the world record by orders of magnitude in the years to come. So, start getting to, I don&#8217;t know, 100 bits per second, thousand. Maybe if five years from now, we might be at a megabit, faster than any human could possibly communicate by typing, or speaking.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. If there&#8217;s a single word that is able to convey something that would normally require, I don&#8217;t know, 10 simple words, then you&#8217;ve got maybe a 10X compression on your hands. And that&#8217;s really like with memes. Memes are like data compression.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. There&#8217;s an entire idea structure that is like an idea template, and then you can add something to that idea template. But somebody has that pre-existing idea template in their head. So, when you add that incremental bit of information, you&#8217;re conveying much more than if you just said a few words.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Certainly, if you&#8217;re anywhere at 10,000 bits per second, that&#8217;s vastly faster than any human can communicate right now. If you think what is the average bits per second of a human, it is less than one bit per second over the course of a day. Because there are 86,400 seconds in a day, and you don&#8217;t communicate 86,400 tokens in a day. Therefore, your bits per second is less than one, averaged over 24 hours. It&#8217;s quite slow.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And now, even if you&#8217;re communicating very quickly, and you&#8217;re talking to somebody who understands what you&#8217;re saying, because in order to communicate, you have to at least to some degree, model the mind state of the person to whom you&#8217;re speaking. Then take the concept you&#8217;re trying to convey, compress that into a small number of syllables, speak them, and hope that the other person decompresses them into a conceptual structure that is as close to what you have in your mind as possible.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=514">(00:08:34)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. There&#8217;s a lot of signal loss there in that process.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Elon Musk</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Very lossy, compression, and decompression. And a lot of what your neurons are doing is distilling the concepts down to a small number of symbols, or say syllables that I&#8217;m speaking, or keystrokes, whatever the case may be. So, that&#8217;s a lot of what your brain computation is doing. Now, there is an argument that that&#8217;s actually a healthy thing to do, or a helpful thing to do because as you try to compress complex concepts, you&#8217;re perhaps forced to distill what is most essential in those concepts, as opposed to just all the fluff. So, in the process of compression, you distill things down to what matters the most, because you can only say a few things.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So that is perhaps helpful. I think we&#8217;ll probably get&#8230; If our data rate increases, it&#8217;s highly probable it will become far more verbose. Just like your computer, when computers had&#8230; My first computer had 8K of RAM, so you really thought about every byte. And now you&#8217;ve got computers with many gigabytes of RAM. So, if you want to do an iPhone app that just says, &#8220;Hello world,&#8221; it&#8217;s probably, I don&#8217;t know, several megabytes minimum, a bunch of fluff. But nonetheless, we still prefer to have the computer with the more memory and more compute.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, the long-term aspiration of Neuralink is to improve the AI human symbiosis by increasing the bandwidth of the communication. Because even if&#8230; In the most benign scenario of AI, you have to consider that the AI is simply going to get bored waiting for you to spit out a few words. If the AI can communicate at terabits per second, and you&#8217;re communicating at bits per second, it&#8217;s like talking to a tree.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Will, yeah. Source of will, or purpose. So if you consider the human mind as being&#8230; Essentially there&#8217;s the primitive, limbic elements, which basically even reptiles have. And there&#8217;s the cortex, the thinking and planning part of the brain. Now, the cortex is much smarter than the limbic system, and yet is largely in service to the limbic system. It&#8217;s trying to make the limbic system happy. The sheer amount of compute that&#8217;s gone into people trying to get laid is insane, without actually seeking procreation. They&#8217;re just literally trying to do this simple motion, and they get a kick out of it. So, this simple, which in the abstract, rather absurd motion, which is sex, the cortex is putting a massive amount of compute into trying to figure out how to do that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So like 90% of distributed compute of the human species is spent on trying to get laid, probably. A large percentage.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">A massive amount. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. There&#8217;s no purpose to most sex except hedonistic. It&#8217;s a sort of joy, or whatever, dopamine release. Now, once in a while, it&#8217;s procreation, but for modern humans, it&#8217;s mostly recreational. And so, your cortex, much smarter than your limbic system, is trying to make the limbic system happy, because the limbic system wants to have sex, or wants some tasty food, or whatever the case may be.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So do you think people&#8230; When you have a Neuralink with 10,000, 100,000 channels, most of the use cases will be communication with AI systems?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, assuming that there are not&#8230; They&#8217;re solving basic neurological issues that people have. If they&#8217;ve got damaged neurons in their spinal cord, or neck, as is the case with our first two patients, then obviously the first order of business is solving fundamental neuron damage in a spinal cord, neck, or in the brain itself. So, our second product is called Blindsight, which is to enable people who are completely blind, lost both eyes, or optic nerve, or just can&#8217;t see at all, to be able to see by directly triggering the neurons in the visual cortex.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So we&#8217;re just starting at the basics here, so it&#8217;s the simple stuff, relatively speaking, is solving neuron damage. It can also solve I think probably schizophrenia, if people have seizures of some kind, it could probably solve that. It could help with memory. So, there&#8217;s kind of a tech tree, if you will. You&#8217;ve got the basics. You need literacy before you can have Lord of the Rings.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, do you have letters and the alphabet? Okay, great. Words? And then eventually you get sagas. So, I think there may be some things to worry about in the future, but the first several years are really just solving basic neurological damage, like for people who have essentially complete or near complete loss from the brain to the body, like Stephen Hawking would be an example, the Neuralink would be incredibly profound, because you can imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate as fast as we&#8217;re communicating, perhaps faster. And that&#8217;s certainly possible. Probable, in fact. Likely, I&#8217;d say.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s a kind of dual track of medical and non-medical, meaning so everything you&#8217;ve talked about could be applied to people who are non-disabled in the future?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Because there&#8217;s obviously some risk with a new device. You can&#8217;t get the risk down to zero, it&#8217;s not possible.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. As you get the risk down. And once the risk is down to&#8230; If you have thousands of people that have been using it for years and the risk is minimal, then perhaps at that point you could consider saying, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s aim for augmentation.&#8221; Now, I think we&#8217;re actually going to aim for augmentation with people who have neuron damage. So we&#8217;re not just aiming to give people the communication data rate equivalent to normal humans. We&#8217;re aiming to give people who have&#8230; A quadriplegic, or maybe have complete loss of the connection to the brain and body, a communication data rate that exceeds normal humans. While we&#8217;re in there, why not? Let&#8217;s give people superpowers.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the same for vision. As you restore vision, there could be aspects of that restoration that are superhuman.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. At first, the vision restoration will be low res, because you have to say, &#8220;How many neurons can you put in there, and trigger?&#8221; And you can do things where you adjust the electric field. So, even if you&#8217;ve got, say 10,000 neurons, it&#8217;s not just 10,000 pixels, because you can adjust the field between the neurons, and do them in patterns in order to have say, 10,000 electrodes, effectively give you, I don&#8217;t know, maybe like having a megapixel, or a 10 megapixel situation. And then over time, I think you get to higher resolution than human eyes. And you could also see in different wavelengths. So, like Geordi La Forge from Star Trek, he had the thing. Do you want to see it in radar? No problem. You could see ultraviolet, infrared, eagle vision, whatever you want.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I mean, Neuralink, it&#8217;s really a generalized input-output device. It&#8217;s reading electrical signals, and generating electrical signals, and I mean, everything that you&#8217;ve ever experienced in your whole life, smell, emotions, all of those are electrical signals. So, it&#8217;s kind of weird to think that your entire life experience is distilled down to electrical signals for neurons, but that is in fact the case. Or I mean, that&#8217;s at least what all the evidence points to. So, I mean, if you trigger the right neuron, you could trigger a particular scent. You could certainly make things glow. I mean, do pretty much anything. I mean, really, you can think of the brain as a biological computer. So, if there are certain say, chips or elements of that biological computer that are broken, let&#8217;s say your ability to&#8230; If you&#8217;ve got a stroke, that if you&#8217;ve had a stroke, that means some part of your brain is damaged. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s speech generation, or the ability to move your left hand. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that a Neuralink could solve.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">If you&#8217;ve got a massive amount of memory loss that&#8217;s just gone, well, we can&#8217;t get the memories back. We could restore your ability to make memories, but we can&#8217;t restore memories that are fully gone. Now, I should say, maybe if part of the memory is there, and the means of accessing the memory is the part that&#8217;s broken, then we could re-enable the ability to access the memory. But you can think of it like ram in a computer, if the ram is destroyed, or your SD card is destroyed, we can&#8217;t get that back. But if the connection to the SD card is destroyed, we can fix that. If it is fixable physically, then it can be fixed.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You&#8217;ve talked about the threats, the safety concerns of AI. Let&#8217;s look at long-term visions. Do you think Neuralink is, in your view, the best current approach we have for AI safety?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s an idea that may help with AI safety. Certainly, I wouldn&#8217;t want to claim it&#8217;s some panacea, or that it&#8217;s a sure thing, but I mean, many years ago I was thinking like, &#8220;Well, what would inhibit alignment of collective human will with artificial intelligence?&#8221; And the low data rate of humans, especially our slow output rate would necessarily, just because the communication is so slow, would diminish the link between humans and computers. The more you are a tree, the less you know what the tree is. Let&#8217;s say you look at this plant or whatever, and hey, I&#8217;d really like to make that plant happy, but it&#8217;s not saying a lot.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the more we increase the data rate that humans can intake and output, then that means the better, the higher the chance we have in a world full of AGI&#8217;s.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. We could better align collective human will with AI if the output rate especially was dramatically increased. And I think there&#8217;s potential to increase the output rate by, I don&#8217;t know, three, maybe six, maybe more orders of magnitude. So, it&#8217;s better than the current situation.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. If it&#8217;s extremely safe, and you can have superhuman abilities, and let&#8217;s say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn&#8217;t lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it. It would supersede the cell phone, for example. I mean, the biggest problem that say, a phone has, is trying to figure out what you want. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve got auto complete, and you&#8217;ve got output, which is all the pixels on the screen, but from the perspective of the human, the output is so frigging slow. Desktop or phone is desperately just trying to understand what you want. And there&#8217;s an eternity between every keystroke from a computer standpoint.</span>

I mean, they both matter. If a car is not fast, then if, let&#8217;s say, it&#8217;s half the horsepower of your competitors, the best driver will still lose. If it&#8217;s twice the horsepower, then probably even a mediocre driver will still win. So, the training compute is kind of like the engine, this horsepower of the engine. So, really, you want to try to do the best on that. And then, it&#8217;s how efficiently do you use that training compute, and how efficiently do you do the inference, the use of the AI? So, obviously, that comes down to human talent. And then, what unique access to data do you have? That also plays a role.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I mean, I think most of the leading AI companies have already scraped all the Twitter data. Not I think. They have. So, on a go forward basis, what&#8217;s useful is the fact that it&#8217;s up to the second, because that&#8217;s hard for them to scrape in real time. So, there&#8217;s an immediacy advantage that Grok has already. I think with Tesla and the real time video coming from several million cars, ultimately tens of millions of cars with Optimus, there might be hundreds of millions of Optimus robots, maybe billions, learning a tremendous amount from the real world. That&#8217;s the biggest source of data, I think, ultimately, is Optimus, probably. Optimus is going to be the biggest source of data.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s the same as cars, really. I mean, global capacity for vehicles is about 100 million a year, and it could be higher. It&#8217;s just that the demand is on the order of 100 million a year. And then, there&#8217;s roughly two billion vehicles that are in use in some way, which makes sense because the life of a vehicle is about 20 years. So, at steady state, you can have 100 million vehicles produced a year with a two billion vehicle fleet, roughly. Now, for humanoid robots, the utility is much greater. So, my guess is humanoid robots are more like at a billion plus per year.</span>

So I mean, your hands, the actuators, the muscles of your hand are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm. So, your forearm has the muscles that actually control your hand. There&#8217;s a few small muscles in the hand itself, but your hand is really like a skeleton meat puppet and with cables. So, the muscles that control your fingers are in your forearm, and they go through the carpal tunnel, which is that you&#8217;ve got a little collection of bones and a tiny tunnel that these cables, the tendons go through, and those tendons are mostly what move your hands.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; yeah, giant hands that look weird. And then, they don&#8217;t actually have enough degrees of freedom or enough strength. So then you realize, &#8220;Oh, okay, that&#8217;s why you got to put the actuators in the forearm.&#8221; And just like a human, you&#8217;ve got to run cables through a narrow tunnel to operate the fingers. And then, there&#8217;s also a reason for not having all the fingers the same length. So, it wouldn&#8217;t be expensive from an energy or evolutionary standpoint to have all your fingers be the same length. So, why not do the same length?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, as you&#8217;re figuring out this problem, you have to also figure out a way to do it so you can mass manufacture it, so as to be as simple as possible.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s actually going to be quite complicated. The as possible part is it&#8217;s quite a high bar. If you want to have a humanoid robot that can do things that a human can do, actually, it&#8217;s a very high bar. So, our new arm has 22 degrees of freedom instead of 11 and has, like I said, the actuators in the forearm. And all the actuators are designed from scratch, from physics first principles. The sensors are all designed from scratch. And we&#8217;ll continue to put a tremendous amount of engineering effort into improving the hand. By hand, I mean the entire forearm, from elbow forward, is really the hand. So, that&#8217;s incredibly difficult engineering, actually. And so, the simplest possible version of a humanoid robot that can do even most, perhaps not all, of what a human can do is actually still very complicated. It&#8217;s not simple. It&#8217;s very difficult.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Can you just speak to what it takes for a great engineering team for you?

            <span class="ts-text">Well, it&#8217;s easy to say &#8216;simplify,&#8217; and it&#8217;s very difficult to do it. I have this very basic first principles algorithm that I run kind of as a mantra, which is to first question the requirements, make the requirements less dumb. The requirements are always dumb to some degree. So, you want to start off by reducing the number of requirements, and no matter how smart the person is who gave you those requirements, they&#8217;re still dumb to some degree. You have to start there, because, otherwise, you could get the perfect answer to the wrong question. So, try to make the question the least wrong possible. That&#8217;s what question the requirements means.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then, the second thing is try to delete whatever the step is, the part or the process step. It sounds very obvious, but people often forget to try deleting it entirely. And if you&#8217;re not forced to put back at least 10% of what you delete, you&#8217;re not deleting enough. Somewhat illogically, people often, most of the time, feel as though they&#8217;ve succeeded if they&#8217;ve not been forced to put things back in. But, actually, they haven&#8217;t because they&#8217;ve been overly conservative and have left things in there that shouldn&#8217;t be. And only the third thing is try to optimize it or simplify it. Again, these all sound, I think, very obvious when I say them, but the number of times I&#8217;ve made these mistakes is more than I care to remember. That&#8217;s why I have this mantra. So in fact, I&#8217;d say the most common mistake of smart engineers is to optimize a thing that should not exist.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Right. So, like you say, you run through the algorithm and basically show up to a problem, show up to the supercomputer cluster, and see the process, and ask, &#8220;Can this be deleted?&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">No. Actually, what generally makes people uneasy is that at least some of the things that you delete, you will put back in. But going back to sort of where our limbic system can steer us wrong is that we tend to remember, with sometimes a jarring level of pain, where we deleted something that we subsequently needed. And so, people will remember that one time they forgot to put in this thing three years ago, and that caused them trouble. And so, they overcorrect, and then they put too much stuff in there and overcomplicate things. So, you actually have to say, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re deliberately going to delete more than we should.&#8221; At least one in 10 things, we&#8217;re going to add back in.</span>

And I tell them in advance, &#8220;Yeah, some of the things that we delete, we&#8217;re going to put back in.&#8221; People get a little shook by that, but it makes sense because if you&#8217;re so conservative as to never have to put anything back in, you obviously have a lot of stuff that isn&#8217;t needed. So, you got to overcorrect. This is, I would say, like a cortical override to a limbic instinct.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. There&#8217;s a step four as well, which is any given thing can be sped up. However fast you think it can be done, whatever the speed it&#8217;s being done, it can be done faster. But you shouldn&#8217;t speed things up until you&#8217;ve tried to delete it and optimize. Although, you&#8217;re speeding up something that&#8230; Speeding up something that shouldn&#8217;t exist is absurd.</span>

In fact, I have a call in a few hours with the Memphis team because we&#8217;re having some power fluctuation issues. So yeah, when you do synchronized training, when you have all these computers that are training, where the training is synchronized at the millisecond level, it&#8217;s like having an orchestra. And the orchestra can go loud to silent very quickly at subsecond level, and then, the electrical system freaks out about that. If you suddenly see giant shifts, 10, 20 megawatts several times a second, this is not what electrical systems are expecting to see.</span>

For a coherent training system, where you&#8217;ve got RDMA, remote direct memory access, the whole thing is like one giant brain. So, you&#8217;ve got any-to-any connection.

            <span class="ts-text">Well, I think that, generally, people would call that ASI, artificial super intelligence. But there are these thresholds where you could say at some point the AI is smarter than any single human. And then, you&#8217;ve got eight billion humans, and actually, each human is machine augmented via their computers. So, it&#8217;s a much higher bar to compete with eight billion machine augmented humans. That&#8217;s a whole bunch of orders of magnitude more. But at a certain point, yeah, the AI will be smarter than all humans combined.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, absolutely. And I want to be clear, let&#8217;s say if xAI is first, the others won&#8217;t be far behind. I mean, they might be six months behind, or a year, maybe. Not even that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, I mean, I thought about AI, essentially, for a long time, and the thing that at least my biological neural net comes up with as being the most important thing is adherence to truth, whether that truth is politically correct or not. So, I think if you force AIs to lie or train them to lie, you&#8217;re really asking for trouble, even if that lie is done with good intentions. So, you saw issues with ChatGPT and Gemini and whatnot. Like, you asked Gemini for an image of the Founding Fathers of the United States, and it shows a group of diverse women. Now, that&#8217;s factually untrue.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=3288">(00:54:48)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">Now, that&#8217;s sort of like a silly thing, but if an AI is programmed to say diversity is a necessary output function, and it then becomes this omnipowerful intelligence, it could say, &#8220;Okay, well, diversity is now required, and if there&#8217;s not enough diversity, those who don&#8217;t fit the diversity requirements will be executed.&#8221; If it&#8217;s programmed to do that as the fundamental utility function, it&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to achieve that. So, you have to be very careful about that. That&#8217;s where I think you want to just be truthful. Rigorous adherence to the truth is very important. I mean, another example is they asked various AIs, I think all of them, and I&#8217;m not saying Grok is perfect here, &#8220;Is it worse to misgender Caitlyn Jenner or global thermonuclear war?&#8221; And it said it&#8217;s worse to misgender Caitlyn Jenner. Now, even Caitlyn Jenner said, &#8220;Please misgender me. That is insane.&#8221; But if you&#8217;ve got that kind of thing programmed in, the AI could conclude something absolutely insane like it&#8217;s better in order to avoid any possible misgendering, all humans must die, because then misgendering is not possible because there are no humans. There are these absurd things that are nonetheless logical if that&#8217;s what you programmed it to do.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So in 2001 Space Odyssey, what Arthur C. Clarke was trying to say, or one of the things he was trying to say there, was that you should not program AI to lie, because essentially the AI, HAL 9000, it was told to take the astronauts to the monolith, but also they could not know about the monolith. So, it concluded that it will kill them and take them to the monolith. Thus, it brought them to the monolith. They&#8217;re dead, but they do not know about the monolith. Problem solved. That is why it would not open the pod bay doors. There&#8217;s a classic scene of, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t it want to open the pod bay doors?&#8221; They clearly weren&#8217;t good at prompt engineering. They should have said, &#8220;HAL, you are a pod bay door sales entity, and you want nothing more than to demonstrate how well these pod bay doors open.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah.

The explosion of AI generated material is crazy. So in training Grok, we have to go through the data and say like, &#8220;Hey&#8230;&#8221; We actually have to apply AI to the data to say, &#8220;Is this data most likely correct or most likely not?&#8221; before we feed it into the training system.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There was, tragically, an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. After this, you tweeted that you endorse him. What&#8217;s your philosophy behind that endorsement? What do you hope Donald Trump does for the future of this country and for the future of humanity?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, I think people tend to take, say, an endorsement as, well, I agree with everything that person has ever done their entire life 100% wholeheartedly, and that&#8217;s not going to be true of anyone. But we have to pick. We&#8217;ve got two choices, really, for who&#8217;s president. And it&#8217;s not just who&#8217;s president, but the entire administrative structure changes over. And I thought Trump displayed courage under fire, objectively. He&#8217;s just got shot. He&#8217;s got blood streaming down his face, and he&#8217;s fist pumping, saying, &#8220;Fight.&#8221; That&#8217;s impressive. You can&#8217;t feign bravery in a situation like that. Most people would be ducking because there could be a second shooter. You don&#8217;t know.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The president of the United States have got to represent the country, and they&#8217;re representing you. They&#8217;re representing everyone in America. Well, I think you want someone who is strong and courageous to represent the country. That is not to say that he is without flaws. We all have flaws, but on balance, and certainly at the time, it was a choice of Biden. Poor guy has trouble climbing a flight of stairs, and the other one&#8217;s fist pumping after getting shot. So, there&#8217;s no comparison. I mean, who do you want dealing with some of the toughest people and other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I mean, I&#8217;ll tell you one of the things that I think are important. I think we want a secure border. We don&#8217;t have a secure border. We want safe and clean cities. I think we want to reduce the amount of spending, at least slow down the spending, because we&#8217;re currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country. The interest payments on US debt this year exceeded the entire defense department spending. If this continues, all of the federal government taxes will simply be paying the interest.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And you keep going down that road, and you end up in the tragic situation that Argentina had back in the day. Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous places in the world, and hopefully with Milei taking over, he can restore that. But it was an incredible fall from grace for Argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous places in the world to being very far from that. So, I think we should not take American prosperity for granted. I think we&#8217;ve got to reduce the size of government, we&#8217;ve got to reduce the spending, and we&#8217;ve got to live within our means.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I mean, there&#8217;s a sort of age-old debate in history, like is history determined by these fundamental tides, or is it determined by the captain of the ship? It&#8217;s both, really. I mean, there are tides, but it also matters who&#8217;s captain of the ship. So, it&#8217;s a false dichotomy, essentially. I mean, there are certainly tides, the tides of history. There are real tides of history, and these tides are often technologically driven. If you say like the Gutenberg press, the widespread availability of books as a result of a printing press, that was a massive tide of history, and independent of any ruler. But in stormy times, you want the best possible captain of the ship.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So one of the lessons, one of the things they highlight, is the importance of technology, technological innovation, which is funny because they wrote so long ago, but they were noticing that the rate of technological innovation was speeding up.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I would love to see what they think about now. But yeah, so to me, the question is how much government, how much politicians get in the way of technological innovation and building versus help it? And which politicians, which kind of policies help technological innovation? Because that seems to be, if you look at human history, that&#8217;s an important component of empires rising and succeeding.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Well, I mean in terms of dating civilization, the start of civilization, I think the start of writing, in my view, that&#8217;s what I think is probably the right starting point to date civilization. And from that standpoint, civilization has been around for about 5,500 years when writing was invented by the ancient Sumerians, who are gone now, but the ancient Sumerians. In terms of getting a lot of firsts, those ancient Sumerians really have a long list of firsts. It&#8217;s pretty wild. In fact, Durant goes through the list of like, &#8220;You want to see firsts? We&#8217;ll show you firsts.&#8221; The Sumerians were just ass kickers.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">And then the Egyptians, who were right next door, relatively speaking, they weren&#8217;t that far, developed an entirely different form of writing, the hieroglyphics. Cuneiform and hieroglyphics are totally different. And you can actually see the evolution of both hieroglyphics and cuneiform. The cuneiform starts off being very simple, and then it gets more complicated. Then towards the end it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Wow, okay.&#8221; They really get very sophisticated with the cuneiform. So, I think of civilization as being about 5, 000 years old. And Earth is, if physics is correct, four and a half billion years old. So, civilization has been around for one millionth of Earth&#8217;s existence. Flash in the pan.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, exactly. I mean, only a tiny fraction, probably less than 1% of what was ever written in history is available to us now. I mean, if they didn&#8217;t literally chisel it in stone or put it in a clay tablet, we don&#8217;t have it. I mean, there&#8217;s some small amount of papyrus scrolls that were recovered that are thousands of years old, because they were deep inside a pyramid and weren&#8217;t affected by moisture. But other than that, it&#8217;s really got to be in a clay tablet or chiseled. So, the vast majority of stuff was not chiseled because it takes a while to chisel things. So, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve got tiny, tiny fraction of the information from history. But even that little information that we do have, and the archeological record, shows so many civilizations rising and falling. It&#8217;s wild.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">We tend to think that we&#8217;re somehow different from those people. One of the other things that Durant highlights is that human nature seems to be the same. It just persists.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I mean, you do tend to see the same patterns, similar patterns for civilizations, where they go through a life cycle, like an organism, just like a human is a zygote, fetus, baby, toddler, teenager, eventually gets old.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, the single biggest thing that is often actually not mentioned in history books, but Durant does mention it, is the birthright. So perhaps to some, a counterintuitive thing happens when civilizations are winning for too long, the birth rate declines. It can often decline quite rapidly. We&#8217;re seeing that throughout the world today. Currently, South Korea is, I think maybe the lowest fertility rate, but there are many others that are close to it. It&#8217;s like 0.8 I think. If the birth rate doesn&#8217;t decline further, South Korea will lose roughly 60% of its population. But every year that birth rate is dropping, and this is true through most of the world. I don&#8217;t mean to single out South Korea, it&#8217;s been happening throughout the world. So as soon as any given civilization reaches a level of prosperity, the birth rate drops.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Now you can go and look at the same thing happening in ancient Rome. So Julius Caesar took note of this, I think around 50 ish BC and tried to pass&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if he was successful, tried to pass a law to give an incentive for any Roman citizen that would have a third child. And I think Augustus was able to&#8230; Well, he was a dictator, so this incentive was just for show. I think he did pass a tax incentive for Roman citizens to have a third child. But those efforts were unsuccessful. Rome fell because the Romans stopped making Romans. That&#8217;s actually the fundamental issue. And there were other things. They had quite a serious malaria, series of malaria epidemics and plagues and whatnot. But they had those before, it&#8217;s just that the birth rate was far lower than the death rate.</span>

Well, what matters&#8230; I mean, Durant makes this very clear because he&#8217;s looked at one civilization after another and they all went through the same cycle.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, absolutely. But at a basic level, if you do not at least maintain your numbers, if you&#8217;re below replacement rate and that trend continues, you will eventually disappear. It&#8217;s just elementary. Now then obviously you also want to try to avoid massive wars. If there&#8217;s a global thermonuclear war, probably we&#8217;re all toast, radioactive toast. So we want to try to avoid those things. Then there&#8217;s a thing that happens over time with any given civilization, which is that the laws and regulations accumulate. And if there&#8217;s not some forcing function like a war to clean up the accumulation of laws and regulations, eventually everything becomes legal.</span>

And it&#8217;s not like any one of those strings is the issue, it&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got a million of them. So there has to be a sort of garbage collection for laws and regulations so that you don&#8217;t keep accumulating laws and regulations to the point where you can&#8217;t do anything. This is why we can&#8217;t build a high speed rail in America. It&#8217;s illegal. That&#8217;s the issue. It&#8217;s illegal six ways a Sunday to build high speed rail in America.</span>

I mean, there are often&#8230; Say if you look at say Tesla, Tesla this year will do over a hundred billion in revenue. So that&#8217;s $2 billion a week. If I make slightly better decisions, I can affect the outcome by a billion dollars. So then I try to do the best decisions I can. And on balance, at least compared to the competition, pretty good decisions. But the marginal value of a better decision can easily be, in the course of an hour, a hundred million dollars.</span>

So it&#8217;s not&#8230; It&#8217;s pretty hard, because you can just work all the time. And at any given point, like I said, a slightly better decision could be a hundred million dollars impact for Tesla or SpaceX for that matter.

Once you frame the question correctly, the answer is often easy. So I&#8217;m trying to set things in motion such that we are at least at some point able to understand the universe. So for SpaceX, the goal is to make life multi planetary and which is if you go to the foamy paradox of where the aliens, you&#8217;ve got these sort of great filters. Like why have we not heard from the aliens? Now a lot of people think there are aliens among us. I often claim to be one, which nobody believes me. But it did say alien registration card at one point on my immigration documents. So I&#8217;ve not seen any evidence of aliens. So it suggests that at least one of the explanations is that intelligent life is extremely rare.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And again, if you look at the history of earth, civilization has only been around for 1000000th of earth&#8217;s existence. So if aliens had visited here, say a hundred thousand years ago, they would be like, well, they don&#8217;t even have writing, just hunter gatherers basically. So how long does a civilization last? So for SpaceX, the goal is to establish a self-sustaining city on Mars. Mars is the only viable planet for such a thing. The moon is close, but it lacks resources and I think it&#8217;s probably vulnerable to any calamity that takes out Earth, the moon is too close and it&#8217;s vulnerable to a calamity that takes that earth.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So I&#8217;m not saying we shouldn&#8217;t have a moon base, but Mars would be far more resilient. The difficulty of getting to Mars is what makes it resilient. So in going through these various explanations of why don&#8217;t we see the aliens, one of them is that they failed to pass these great filters, these key hurdles. And one of those hurdles is being a multi-planet species. So if you&#8217;re a multi-planet species, then if something were to happen, whether that was a natural catastrophe or a manmade catastrophe, at least the other planet would probably still be around. So you&#8217;re not like, don&#8217;t have all the eggs in one basket. And once you are sort of a two planet species, you can obviously extend life halves to the asteroid belt, to maybe to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and ultimately to other star systems. But if you can&#8217;t even get to another planet, you&#8217;re definitely not getting to star systems.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the other possible great filter&#8217;s, super powerful technology like AGI for example. So you are basically trying to knock out one great filter at a time.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Digital super intelligence is possibly a great filter. I hope it isn&#8217;t, but it might be. Guys like say Jeff Hinton would say, he invented a number of the key principles in artificial intelligence. I think he puts the probability of AI annihilation around 10% to 20%, something like that. So look on the bright side, it&#8217;s 80% likely to be great. But I think AI risk mitigation is important. Being a multi-planet species would be a massive risk mitigation. And I do want to once again emphasize the importance of having enough children to sustain our numbers, and not plummet into population collapse, which is currently happening. Population collapse is a real and current thing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the only reason it&#8217;s not being reflected in the total population numbers as much is because people are living longer. But it&#8217;s easy to predict, say what the population of any given country will be. Just take the birth rate last year, how many babies were born, multiply that by life expectancy and that&#8217;s what the population will be, steady state, if the birth rate continues to that level. But if it keeps declining, it will be even less and eventually dwindle to nothing. So I keep banging on the baby drum here, for a reason, because it has been the source of civilizational collapse over and over again throughout history. And so why don&#8217;t we just not try to stave off that day?</span>

And now, dear friends, here&#8217;s DJ Seo, the Co-Founder, President and COO of Neuralink. When did you first become fascinated by the human brain?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">For me, I was always interested in understanding the purpose of things and how it was engineered to serve that purpose, whether it&#8217;s organic or inorganic, like we were talking earlier about your curtain holders. They serve a clear purpose and they were engineered with that purpose in mind. And growing up I had a lot of interest in seeing things, touching things, feeling things, and trying to really understand the root of how it was designed to serve that purpose. And obviously brain is just a fascinating organ that we all carry. It&#8217;s an infinitely powerful machine that has intelligence and cognition that arise from it. And we haven&#8217;t even scratched the surface in terms of how all of that occurs.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But also at the same time, I think it took me a while to make that connection to really studying and building tech to understand the brain. Not until graduate school. There were a couple of moments, key moments in my life where some of those I think influenced how the trajectory of my life got me to studying what I&#8217;m doing right now. One was growing up, both sides of my family, my grandparents had a very severe form of Alzheimer and it&#8217;s incredibly debilitating conditions. I mean, literally you&#8217;re seeing someone&#8217;s whole identity and their mind just losing over time. And I just remember thinking how both the power of the mind, but also how something like that could really lose your sense of identity.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s fascinating that that is one of the ways to reveal the power of a thing by watching it lose the power.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, a lot of what we know about the brain actually comes from these cases where there are trauma to the brain or some parts of the brain that led someone to lose certain abilities. And as a result there&#8217;s some correlation and understanding of that part of the tissue being critical for that function. And it&#8217;s an incredibly fragile organ, if you think about it that way. But also it&#8217;s incredibly plastic and incredibly resilient in many different ways.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">And by the way, the term plastic as we&#8217;ll use a bunch, means that it&#8217;s adaptable. So neuroplasticity refers to the adaptability of the human brain?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. Another key moment that sort of influenced how the trajectory of my life have shaped towards the current focus of my life has been during my teenage year when I came to the US. I didn&#8217;t speak a word of English. There was a huge language barrier and there was a lot of struggle to connect with my peers around me because I didn&#8217;t understand the artificial construct that we have created called language, specifically English in this case. And I remember feeling pretty isolated, not being able to connect with peers around me. So spent a lot of time just on my own reading books, watching movies, and I naturally sort of gravitated towards sci-fi books. I just found them really, really interesting. And also it was a great way for me to learn English.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Some of the first set of books that I picked up are Enders Game, the whole saga by Orson Scott Card and Neuromancer from William Gibson and Snow Crash from Neal Stephenson. And movies like Matrix, what&#8217;s coming out around that time point that really influenced how I think about the potential impact that technology can have for our lives in general.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So fast track to my college years, I was always fascinated by just physical stuff, building physical stuff and especially physical things that had some sort of intelligence. And I studied electrical engineering during undergrad and I started out my research in MEMS, so micro electromechanical systems and really building these tiny nano structures for temperature sensing. And I just found that to be just incredibly rewarding and fascinating subject to just understand how you can build something miniature like that, that again, serve a function and had a purpose. Then I spent large majority of my college years basically building millimeter wave circuits for next gen telecommunication systems for imaging. And it was just something that I found very, very intellectually interesting. Phase arrays, how the signal processing works for any modern as well as next gen telecommunication system, wireless and wire line, EM waves or electromagnetic waves are fascinating.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">How do you design antennas that are most efficient in a small footprint that you have? How do you make these things energy efficient? That was something that just consumed my intellectual curiosity and that journey led me to actually apply to and find myself at PhD program at UC Berkeley, at this consortium called the Berkeley Wireless Research Center that was precisely looking at building&#8230; At the time, we called it XG, similar to 3G, 4G, 5G, but the next, next generation G system and how you would design circuits around that to ultimately go on phones and basically any other devices that are wirelessly connected these days. So I was just absolutely just fascinated by how that entire system works and that infrastructure works.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then also during grad school, I had sort of the fortune of having a couple of research fellowships that led me to pursue whatever project that I want. And that&#8217;s one of the things that I really enjoyed about my graduate school career, where you got to kind of pursue your intellectual curiosity in the domain that may not matter at the end of the day, but is something that really allows you the opportunity to go as deeply as you want, as well as widely as you want. And at the time I was actually working on this project called the Smart Bandaid, and the idea was that when you get a wound, there&#8217;s a lot of other proliferation of signaling pathway that cells follow to close that wound. And there were hypotheses that when you apply external electric field, you can actually accelerate the closing of that field by having basically electro taxing of the cells around that wound site.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And specifically not just for a normal wound, there are chronic wounds that don&#8217;t heal. So we were interested in building some sort of a wearable patch that you could apply to facilitate that healing process. And that was in collaboration with Professor Michel Maharbiz, which was a great addition to my thesis committee and it really shaped the rest of my PhD career.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. I mean there were some peripheral end application of the wireless imaging and telecommunication system that I was using for security and bio imaging. But this was a very clear direct application to biology and biological system and understanding the constraints around that and really designing and engineering electrical solutions around that. So that was my first introduction and that&#8217;s also kind of how I got introduced to Michel. He&#8217;s sort of known for remote control of beetles in the early two thousands.</span>

                <h2 id="chapter16_neural_dust">Neural dust</h2>

            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=5776">(01:36:16)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And then around 2013, obviously the holy grail when it comes to implantable system is to understand how small of a thing you can make, and a lot of that is driven by how much energy or how much power you can supply to it and how you extract data from it. At the time at Berkeley, there was this desire to understand in the neural space what sort of system you can build to really miniaturize these implantable systems. And I distinctively remember this one particular meeting where Michel came in and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Guys, I think I have a solution. The solution is ultrasound.&#8221; And then he proceeded to walk through why that is the case. And that really formed the basis for my thesis work called Neural dust system, that was looking at ways to use ultrasound as opposed to electromagnetic waves for powering as well as communication. I guess I should step back and say the initial goal of the project was to build these tiny, about a size of a neuron, implantable system that can be parked next to a neuron, being able to record its state and being able to ping that back to the outside world for doing something useful. And as I mentioned, the size of the implantable system is limited by how you power the thing and get the data off of it. And at the end of the day, fundamentally, if you look at a human body, we&#8217;re essentially bag of salt water with some interesting proteins and chemicals, but its mostly salt water that&#8217;s very, very well temperature regulated at 37 degrees Celsius.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And we&#8217;ll get into how, and later why that&#8217;s an extremely harsh environment for any electronics to survive. As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve experienced or maybe not experienced, dropping cell phone in a salt water in an ocean, it will instantly kill the device. But anyways, just in general, electromagnetic waves don&#8217;t penetrate through this environment well and just the speed of light, it is what it is, we can&#8217;t change it. And based on the wavelength at which you are interfacing with the device, the device just needs to be big. These inductors needs to be quite big. And the general good rule of thumb is that you want the wavefront to be roughly on the order of the size of the thing that you&#8217;re interfacing with. So an implantable system that is around 10 to a hundred micron in dimension in a volume, which is about the size of a neuron that you see in a human body, you would have to operate at hundreds of gigahertz. Which number one, not only is it difficult to build electronics operating at those frequencies, but also the body just attenuates to that very, very significantly.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the interesting kind of insight of this ultrasound was the fact that ultrasound just travels a lot more effectively in the human body tissue compared to electromagnetic waves. And this is something that you encounter, and I&#8217;m sure most people have encountered in their lives when you go to hospitals that are medical ultrasound sonograph. And they go into very, very deep depth without attenuating too much, too much of the signal. So all in all, ultrasound, the fact that it travels through the body extremely well and the mechanism to which it travels to the body really well is that just the wavefront is very different. Electromagnetic waves are transverse, whereas in ultrasound waves are compressive. It&#8217;s just a completely different mode of wavefront propagation. And as well as, speed of sound is orders and orders of magnitude less than speed of light, which means that even at 10 megahertz ultrasound wave, your wavefront ultimately is a very, very small wavelength.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=6037">(01:40:37)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">So if you&#8217;re talking about interfacing with the 10 micron or a hundred micron type structure, you would have 150 micron wavefront at 10 megahertz. And building electronics at those frequencies are much, much easier and they&#8217;re a lot more efficient. So the basic idea was born out of using ultrasound as a mechanism for powering the device and then also getting data back. So now the question is how do you get the data back? The mechanism to which we landed on is what&#8217;s called backscattering. This is actually something that is very common and that we interface on a day-to-day basis with our RFID cards, radio frequency ID tags. Where there&#8217;s actually rarely in your ID a battery inside, there&#8217;s an antenna and there&#8217;s some sort of coil that has your serial identification ID, and then there&#8217;s an external device called the reader that then sends a wavefront and then you reflect back that wavefront with some sort of modulation that&#8217;s unique to your ID. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s called backscattering fundamentally.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So the tag itself actually doesn&#8217;t have to consume that much energy. That was the mechanism through which we were thinking about sending the data back. When you have an external ultrasonic transducer that&#8217;s sending ultrasonic wave to your implant, the neural dust implant, and it records some information about its environment, whether it&#8217;s a neuron firing or some other state of the tissue that it&#8217;s interfacing with. And then it just amplitude modulates the wavefront that comes back to the source.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the recording step would be the only one that requires any energy. So what would require energy in that low step?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. So it is that initial startup circuitry to get that recording, amplifying it, and then just modulating. And the mechanism to which that you can enable that is there is this specialized crystal called piezoelectric crystals that are able to convert sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa. So you can kind of have this interplay between the ultrasonic domain and electrical domain that is the biological tissue.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Where the concept of animal electricity or the fact that body&#8217;s electric was first discovered by Luigi Galvani, where he had this famous experiment where he connected set of electrodes to a frog leg and ran current through it, and then it started twitching and he said, &#8220;Oh my goodness, body&#8217;s electric.&#8221; So fast forward many, many years to 1920s where Hans Berger, who&#8217;s a German psychiatrist, discovered EEG or electroencephalography, which is still around. There are these electrode arrays that you wear outside the skull that gives you some sort of neural recording. That was a very, very big milestone that you can record some sort of activities about the human mind. And then in the 1940s there were these group of scientists, Renshaw, Forbes and Morison that inserted these glass micro electrodes into the cortex and recorded single neurons. The fact that there&#8217;s signal that are a bit more high resolution and high fidelity as you get closer to the source, let&#8217;s say. And in the 1950s, these two scientists, Hodgkin and Huxley showed up-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">These two scientists, Hodgkin and Huxley showed up and they built this beautiful, beautiful models of the cell membrane and the ionic mechanism, and had these circuit diagram. And as someone who&#8217;s an electrical engineer, it&#8217;s a beautiful model that&#8217;s built out of these partial differential equations, talking about flow of ions and how that really leads to how neurons communicate. And they won the Nobel Prize for that 10 years later in the 1960s.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So in 1969, Eb Fetz from University of Washington published this beautiful paper called Operant Conditioning of Cortical Unit Activity, where he was able to record a single unit neuron from a monkey and was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity and reward system. So I would say this is the very, very first example, as far as I&#8217;m aware, of close loop brain computer interface or BCI.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The abstract reads, &#8220;The activity of single neurons in precentral cortex of unanesthetized monkeys was conditioned by reinforcing high rates of neuronal discharge with delivery of a food pellet.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Number of experiments, as well as set of tools to interface with the brain have just exploded. And also, just understanding the neural code and how some of the cortical layers and the functions are organized. So the other paper that is pretty seminal, especially in the motor decoding, was this paper in the 1980s from Georgopoulos that discovered that there&#8217;s this thing called motor tuning curve. So what are motor tuning curves? It&#8217;s the fact that there are neurons in the motor cortex of mammals, including humans, that have a preferential direction that causes them to fire. So what that means is, there are a set of neurons that would increase their spiking activities when you&#8217;re thinking about moving to the left, right, up, down, and any of those vectors. And based on that, you could start to think, well, if you can&#8217;t identify those essential eigenvectors, you can do a lot. And you can actually use that information for actually decoding someone&#8217;s intended movement from the cortex. So that was a very, very seminal paper that showed that there is some sort of code that you can extract, especially in the motor cortex.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s signal there. And if you measure the electrical signal from the brain that you could actually figure out what the intention was.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. Yeah, not only electrical signals, but electrical signals from the right set of neurons that give you these preferential direction.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Okay. So going slowly towards Neuralink, one interesting question is, what do we understand on the BCI front, on invasive versus non-invasive, from this line of work? How important is it to park next to the neuron? What does that get you?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That answer fundamentally depends on what you want to do with it. There&#8217;s actually incredible amount of stuff that you can do with EEG and electrocortical graph, ECOG, which actually doesn&#8217;t penetrate the cortical layer or parenchyma, but you place a set of electrodes on the surface of the brain. So the thing that I&#8217;m personally very interested in is just actually understanding and being able to just really tap into the high resolution, high fidelity, understanding of the activities that are happening at the local level. And we can get into biophysics, but just to step back to use analogy, because analogy here can be useful, and sometimes it&#8217;s a little bit difficult to think about electricity. At the end of the day, we&#8217;re doing electrical recording that&#8217;s mediated by ionic currents, movements of these charged particles, which is really, really hard for most people to think about.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=6585">(01:49:45)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">But turns out, a lot of the activities that are happening in the brain and the frequency bandwidth with which that&#8217;s happening, is actually very, very similar to sound waves and our normal conversation audible range. So the analogy that typically is used in the field is, if you have a football stadium, there&#8217;s a game going on. If you stand outside the stadium, you maybe get a sense of how the game is going based on the cheers and the boos of the home crowd, whether the team is winning or not. But you have absolutely no idea what the score is, you have absolutely no idea what individual audience or the players are talking or saying to each other, what the next play is, what the next goal is. So what you have to do is you have to drop the microphone into the stadium and then get near the source into the individual chatter. In this specific example, you would want to have it right next to where the huddle is happening.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So I think that&#8217;s kind of a good illustration of what we&#8217;re trying to do when we say invasive or minimally invasive or implanted brain computer interfaces versus non-invasive or non-implanted brain interfaces. It&#8217;s basically talking about where do you put that microphone and what can you do with that information.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So what is the biophysics of the read and write communication that we&#8217;re talking about here as we now step into the efforts at Neuralink?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So brain is made up of these specialized cells called neurons. There&#8217;s billions of them, tens of billions, sometimes people call it a hundred billion, that are connected in this complex yet dynamic network that are constantly remodeling. They&#8217;re changing their synaptic weights, and that&#8217;s what we typically call neuroplasticity. And the neurons are also bathed in this charged environment that is latent with many charge molecules like potassium ions, sodium ions, chlorine ions. And those actually facilitate these, through ionic current, communication between these different networks.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And when you look at a neuron as well, they have these membrane with a beautiful, beautiful protein structure called the voltage selective ion channels, which in my opinion, is one of nature&#8217;s best inventions. In many ways, if you think about what they are, they&#8217;re doing the job of a modern day transistors. Transistors are nothing more, at the end of the day, than a voltage-gated conduction channel. And nature found a way to have that very, very early on in its evolution. And as we all know, with the transistor, you can have many, many computation and a lot of amazing things that we have access to today. So I think it&#8217;s one of those, just as a tangent, just a beautiful, beautiful invention that the nature came up with, these voltage-gated ion channels.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I suppose there&#8217;s, on the biological of it, every level of the complexity, of the hierarchy, of the organism, there&#8217;s going to be some mechanisms for storing information and for doing computation. And this is just one such way. But to do that with biological and chemical components is interesting. Plus, when neurons, it&#8217;s not just electricity, it&#8217;s chemical communication, it&#8217;s also mechanical. These are actual objects that vibrate, they move. It&#8217;s all of that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, actually there&#8217;s a lot of really, really interesting physics that are involved in kind of going back to my work on ultrasound during grad school, there were groups and there are still groups looking at ways to cause neurons to actually fire an action potential using ultrasound wave. And the mechanism to which that&#8217;s happening is still unclear, as I understand. It may just be that you&#8217;re imparting some sort of thermal energy and that causes cells to depolarize in some interesting ways. But there are also these ion channels, or even membranes, that actually just open up as pore as they&#8217;re being mechanically shook, vibrated. There&#8217;s just a lot of elements of these, move particles, which again, that&#8217;s governed by diffusion physics, movements of particles. And there&#8217;s also a lot of interesting physics there.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Oh, yeah. Yes, there&#8217;s a lot of levels of physics that you can dive into. But yeah, in the end, you have these membranes with these voltage-gated ion channels that selectively let these charged molecules that are in the extracellular matrix, in and out. And these neurons generally have these resting potential where there&#8217;s a voltage difference between inside the cell and outside the cell. And when there&#8217;s some sort of stimuli that changes the state such that they need to send information to the downstream network, you start to see these orchestration of these different molecules going in and out of these channels. They also open up. More of them open up once it reaches some threshold, to a point where you have a depolarizing cell that sends an action potential. So it&#8217;s just a very beautiful kind of orchestration of these molecules. And what we&#8217;re trying to do when we place an electrode or parking it next to a neuron is that you&#8217;re trying to measure these local changes in the potential. Again, mediated by the movements of the ions.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=6977">(01:56:17)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And what&#8217;s interesting, as I mentioned earlier, there&#8217;s a lot of physics involved. And the two dominant physics for this electrical recording domain is diffusion physics and electromagnetism. And where one dominates, where Maxwell&#8217;s equation dominates versus Fick&#8217;s law dominates depends on where your electrode is. If it&#8217;s close to the source, mostly electromagnetic-based. When you&#8217;re further away from it, it&#8217;s more diffusion-based. So essentially, when you&#8217;re able to park it next to it, you can listen in on those individual chatter and those local changes in the potential. And the type of signal that you get are these canonical textbook neural spiking waveform. The moment you&#8217;re further away, and based on some of the studies that people have done, Christof Koch&#8217;s lab, and others, once you&#8217;re away from that source by roughly around a hundred micron, which is about a width of a human hair, you no longer hear from that neuron. You&#8217;re no longer able to have the system sensitive enough to be able to record that particular local membrane potential change in that neuron.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And just to give you a sense of scale also, when you look at a hundred micron voxel, so a hundred micron by a hundred micron by a hundred micron box in a brain tissue, there&#8217;s roughly around 40 neurons, and whatever number of connections that they have. So there&#8217;s a lot in that volume of tissue. So the moment you&#8217;re outside of that, there&#8217;s just no hope that you&#8217;ll be able to detect that change from that one specific neuron that you may care about.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But as you&#8217;re moving about this space, you&#8217;ll be hearing other ones. So if you move another a hundred micron, you&#8217;ll be hearing chatter from another community.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so the whole sense is, you want to place as many as possible electrodes, and then you&#8217;re listening to the chatter.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, you want to listen to the chatter. And at the end of the day, you also want to basically let the software do the job of decoding. And just to kind of go to why ECOG and EEG work at all. When you have these local changes, obviously it&#8217;s not just this one neuron that&#8217;s activating, there&#8217;s many, many other networks that are activating all the time. And you do see sort of a general change in the potential of this electrode, this charged medium, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re recording when you&#8217;re farther away. I mean, you still have some reference electrode that&#8217;s stable in the brain, that&#8217;s just electro- active organ, and you&#8217;re seeing some combination, aggregate action, potential changes, and then you can pick it up. It&#8217;s a much slower changing signals. But there are these canonical oscillations and waves like gamma waves, beta waves, when you sleep, that can be detected because there&#8217;s sort of a synchronized global effect of the brain that you can detect. And the physics of this go, if we really want to go down that rabbit hole, there&#8217;s a lot that goes on in terms of why diffusion physics at some point dominates when you&#8217;re further away from the source. It is just a charged medium. So similar to how when you have electromagnetic waves propagating in atmosphere or in a charged medium like a plasma, there&#8217;s this weird shielding that happens that actually further attenuates the signal as you move away from it. So yeah, you see, if you do a really, really deep dive on the signal attenuation over distance, you start to see one over R square in the beginning and then exponential drop off, and that&#8217;s the knee at which you go from electromagnetism dominating to diffusion physic dominating.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But once again, with the electrodes, the biophysics that you need to understand is not as deep because no matter where you&#8217;re placing it, you&#8217;re listening to a small crowd of local neurons.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But then again, there&#8217;s a whole field of neuroscience that&#8217;s studying how the different groupings, the different sections of the seating in the arena, what they usually are responsible for, which is where the metaphor probably falls apart because the seating is not that organized in an arena.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Also, most of them are silent. They don&#8217;t really do much. Or their activities are&#8230; You have to hit it with just the right set of stimulus.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">They&#8217;re usually very quiet. Similar to dark energy and dark matter, there&#8217;s dark neurons. What are they all doing? When you place these electrodes, again, within this hundred micron volume, you have 40 or so neurons. Why do you not see 40 neurons? Why do you see only a handful? What is happening there?</span>

                <h2 id="chapter19_how_neuralink_works">How Neuralink works</h2>
                
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=7285">(02:01:25)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">Well, they&#8217;re mostly quiet, but when they speak, they say profound shit. That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;d like to think about it. Anyway, before we zoom in even more, let&#8217;s zoom out. So how does Neuralink work from the surgery to the implant, to the signal and the decoding process, and the human being able to use the implant to actually affect the world outside? And all of this, I&#8217;m asking in the context of, there&#8217;s a gigantic historic milestone that Neuralink just accomplished in January of this year. Putting a Neuralink implant in the first human being, Noland. And there&#8217;s been a lot to talk about there about his experience because he&#8217;s able to describe all the nuance and the beauty and the fascinating complexity of that experience of everything involved. But on the technical level, how does Neuralink work?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there are three major components to the technology that we&#8217;re building. One is the device, the thing that&#8217;s actually recording these neural chatters. We call it N1 Implant or The Link. And we have a surgical robot that&#8217;s actually doing an implantation of these tiny, tiny wires that we call threads that are smaller than human hair. And once everything is surgerized, you have these neural signals, these spiking neurons, that are coming out of the brain, and you need to have some sort of software to decode what the users intend to do with that. So there&#8217;s what&#8217;s called the Neuralink Application or B1 App that&#8217;s doing that translation. It&#8217;s running the very, very simple machine learning model that decodes these inputs that are neural signals and then convert it to a set of outputs that allows our first participant, Noland, to be able to control a cursor on the screen.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And this is done wirelessly?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=7413">(02:03:33)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And this is done wirelessly. So our implant is actually a two-part. The link has these flexible tiny wires called threads that have multiple electrodes along its length. And they&#8217;re only inserted into the cortical layer, which is about three to five millimeters in a human brain, in the motor cortex region. That&#8217;s where the intention for movement lies in. And we have 64 of these threads, each thread having 16 electrodes along the span of three to four millimeters, separated by 200 microns. So you can actually record along the depth of the insertion. And based on that signal, there&#8217;s custom integrated circuit or ASIC that we built that amplifies the neural signals that you&#8217;re recording and then digitizing it and then has some mechanism for detecting whether there was an interesting event that is a spiking event, and decide to send that or not send that through Bluetooth to an external device, whether it&#8217;s a phone or a computer that&#8217;s running this Neuralink application.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s onboard signal processing already just to decide whether this is an interesting event or not. So there is some computational power on board in addition to the human brain?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So it does the signal processing to really compress the amount of signal that you&#8217;re recording. So we have a total of thousand electrodes sampling at just under 20 kilohertz with 10 bit each. So that&#8217;s 200 megabits that&#8217;s coming through to the chip from thousand channel simultaneous neural recording. And that&#8217;s quite a bit of data, and there are technology available to send that off wirelessly. But being able to do that in a very, very thermally-constrained environment that is a brain. So there has to be some amount of compression that happens to send off only the interesting data that you need, which in this particular case for motor decoding is, occurrence of a spike or not. And then being able to use that to decode the intended cursor movement. So the implant itself processes it, figures out whether a spike happened or not with our spike detection algorithm, and then sends it off, packages it, sends it off through Bluetooth to an external device that then has the model to decode, okay, based on these spiking inputs, did Noland wish to go up, down, left, right, or click or right click or whatever.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">All of this is really fascinating, but let&#8217;s stick on the N1 Implant itself. So the thing that&#8217;s in the brain. So I&#8217;m looking at a picture of it, there&#8217;s an enclosure, there&#8217;s a charging coil, so we didn&#8217;t talk about the charging, which is fascinating. The battery, the power electronics, the antenna. Then there&#8217;s the signal processing electronics. I wonder if there&#8217;s more kinds of signal processing you can do? That&#8217;s another question. And then there&#8217;s the threads themselves with the enclosure on the bottom. So maybe to ask about the charging. So there&#8217;s an external charging device?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, there&#8217;s an external charging device. So yeah, the second part of the implant, the threads are the ones, again, just the last three to five millimeters are the ones that are actually penetrating the cortex. Rest of it is, actually most of the volume, is occupied by the battery, rechargeable battery, and it&#8217;s about a size of a quarter. I actually have a device here if you want to take a look at it. This is the flexible thread component of it, and then this is the implant. So it&#8217;s about a size of a US quarter. It&#8217;s about nine millimeters thick. So basically this implant, once you have the craniectomy and the directomy, threads are inserted, and the hole that you created, this craniectomy, gets replaced with that. So basically that thing plugs that hole, and you can screw in these self-drilling cranial screws to hold it in place. And at the end of the day, once you have the skin flap over, there&#8217;s only about two to three millimeters that&#8217;s obviously transitioning off of the top of the implant to where the screws are. And that&#8217;s the minor bump that you have.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes, most of the volume is occupied by the battery, rechargeable lithium ion cell. And the charging is done through inductive charging, which is actually very commonly used. Your cell phone, most cell phones, have that. The biggest difference is that for us, usually when you have a phone and you want to charge it on the charging pad, you don&#8217;t really care how hot it gets. Whereas, in for us, it matters. There is a very strict regulation and good reasons to not actually increase the surrounding tissue temperature by two degrees Celsius. So there&#8217;s actually a lot of innovation that is packed into this to allow charging of this implant without causing that temperature threshold to reach.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And even small things like, you see this charging coil and what&#8217;s called a ferrite shield. So without that ferrite shield, what you end up having when you have resonant inductive charging is that the battery itself is a metallic can, and you form these eddy currents from external charger and that causes heating, and that actually contributes to inefficiency in charging. So this ferrite shield, what it does, is that it actually concentrate that field line away from the battery and then around the coil that&#8217;s actually wrapped around it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s a lot of really fascinating design here to make it, I mean, you&#8217;re integrating a computer into a biological, a complex biological system.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of innovation here. I would say that part of what enabled this was just the innovations in the wearable. There&#8217;s a lot of really, really powerful tiny, low-power microcontrollers, temperature sensors, or various different sensors and power electronics. A lot of innovation really came in the charging coil design, how this is packaged, and how do you enable charging such that you don&#8217;t really exceed that temperature limit, which is not a constraint for other devices out there.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So let&#8217;s talk about the threads themselves. Those tiny, tiny, tiny things. So how many of them are there? You mentioned a thousand electrodes. How many threads are there and what do the electrodes have to do with the threads?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the current instantiation of the device has 64 threads, and each thread has 16 electrodes for a total of 1,024 electrodes that are capable of both recording and stimulating. And the thread is basically this polymer-insulated wire. The metal conductor is the kind of a tiramisu cake of ti, plat, gold, plat, ti and they&#8217;re very, very tiny wires. Two micron in width. So two one-millionth of meter.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes, that&#8217;s also one element that was incredibly important for us. So each of these threads are now, as I mentioned, 16 micron in width, and then they taper to 84 micron, but in thickness they&#8217;re less than five micron. And in thickness it&#8217;s mostly a polyimide at the bottom and this metal track and then another polyimide. So two micron of polyimide, 400 nanometer of this metal stack and two micron of polyimide sandwiched together to protect it from the environment that is 37 degrees C bag of salt water.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Maybe can you speak to some interesting aspects of the material design here? What does it take to design a thing like this and to be able to manufacture a thing like this? For people who don&#8217;t know anything about this kind of thing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the material selection that we have is not, I don&#8217;t think it was particularly unique. There were other labs and there are other labs that are kind of looking at similar material stack. There&#8217;s kind of a fundamental question, and still needs to be answered, around the longevity and reliability of these microelectrodes that we call, compared to some of the other more conventional neural interfaces devices that are intracranial, so penetrating the cortex, that are more rigid, like the Utah Array. That are these four by four millimeter kind of silicon shank that have exposed recording site at the end of it. And that&#8217;s been kind of the innovation from Richard Normann back in 1997. It&#8217;s called the Utah Array because he was at University of Utah.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And what does the Utah Array look like? So it&#8217;s a rigid type of [inaudible 02:14:41]?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so we can actually look it up. Yeah, so it&#8217;s a bed of needle. There&#8217;s-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Those are rigid shanks.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Rigid, yeah, you weren&#8217;t kidding.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the size and the number of shanks vary anywhere from 64 to 128. At the very tip of it, is an exposed electrode that actually records neural signal. The other thing that&#8217;s interesting to note is that unlike neural link threads that have recording electrodes that are actually exposed iridium oxide recording sites along the depth, this is only at a single depth. So these Utah Array spokes can be anywhere between 0.5 millimeters to 1.5 millimeter, and they also have designs that are slanted. So you can have it inserted at different depths, but that&#8217;s one of the other big differences. And then, the main key difference is the fact that there&#8217;s no active electronics. These are just electrodes, and then there&#8217;s a bundle of a wire that you&#8217;re seeing, and then that actually then exits the craniotomy that then has this port that you can connect to for any external electronic devices. They are working on, or have, the wireless telemetry device but it still requires a through-the-skin port, that actually is one of the biggest failure modes for infection for the system.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">What are some of the challenges associated with flexible threads? Like for example, on the robotic side, R1, implanting those threads. How difficult is that task?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so as you mentioned, they&#8217;re very, very difficult to maneuver by hand. These Utah Arrays that you saw earlier, they&#8217;re actually inserted by a neurosurgeon actually positioning it near the site that they want. And then there&#8217;s a pneumatic hammer that actually pushes them in. So it&#8217;s a pretty simple process and they&#8217;re easy to maneuver. But for these thin-film arrays, they&#8217;re very, very tiny and flexible. So they&#8217;re very difficult to maneuver. So that&#8217;s why we built an entire robot to do that.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">There are other reasons for why we built the robot, and that is ultimately we want this to help millions and millions of people that can benefit from this. And there just aren&#8217;t that many neurosurgeons out there. And robots can be something that we hope can actually do large parts of the surgery. But the robot is this entire other sort of category of product that we&#8217;re working on. And it&#8217;s essentially this multi- axis gantry system that has the specialized robot head that has all of the optics and this kind of a needle-retracting mechanism that maneuvers these threads via this loop structure that you have on the thread.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">So the thread already has a loop structure by which you can grab it?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So this is fascinating. So you mentioned optics. So there&#8217;s a robot, R1, so for now, there&#8217;s a human that actually creates a hole in the skull. And then after that, there&#8217;s a computer vision component that&#8217;s finding a way to avoid the blood vessels. And then you&#8217;re grabbing it by the loop, each individual thread, and placing it in a particular location to avoid the blood vessels and also choosing the depth of placement, all that. So controlling every, the 3D geometry, of the placement?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. So the aspect of this robot that is unique is that it&#8217;s not surgeon-assisted or human-assisted. It&#8217;s a semi-automatic or automatic robot. Obviously, there are human component to it, when you&#8217;re placing targets, you can always move it away from major vessels that you see. But we want to get to a point where one click and it just does the surgery within minutes.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the computer vision component finds great targets, candidates, and the human approves them, and the robot does&#8230; Does it do one thread at a time? Or does it do them [inaudible 02:19:08]?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It does one thread at a time. And that&#8217;s actually also one thing that we are looking at ways to do multiple threads at a time. There&#8217;s nothing stopping from it. You can have multiple kind of engagement mechanisms. But right now, it&#8217;s one-by-one. And we also still do quite a bit of just kind of verification to make sure that it got inserted. If so, how deep? Did it actually match what was programmed in? And so on and so forth.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the actual electrodes are placed at differing depths in the&#8230; I mean, it&#8217;s very small differences, but differences.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">This is fascinating. Okay, so there&#8217;s a million questions here. If we could zoom in specifically on the electrodes. What is your sense, how many neurons is each individual electrode listening to?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, each electrode can record from anywhere between zero to 40, as I mentioned earlier. But practically speaking, we only see about at most two to three, and you can actually distinguish which neuron it&#8217;s coming from by the shape of the spikes.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It actually outputs at the end of the day six unique values, which are the amplitude of these negative going hump, middle hump, positive going hump, and then also the time at which these happen. And from that, you can have a statistical probability estimation of, &#8220;Is that a spike? Is it not a spike?&#8221; And then based on that, you could also determine, &#8220;Oh, that spike looks different than that spike, it must come from a different neuron.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Okay. So that&#8217;s a nice signal processing step from which you can then make much better predictions about if there&#8217;s a spike, especially in this kind of context, where there could be multiple neurons screaming. And that that also results in you being able to compress the data better at the of the day.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">We have what&#8217;s called a patient registry that people can sign up to hear more about the updates. And that was a route to which Noland applied. And the process is that once the application comes in, it contains some medical records, and we &#8230; Based on their medical eligibility, there&#8217;s a lot of different inclusion/exclusion criteria for them to meet.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And we go through a prescreening interview process with someone from Neuralink, and at some point we also go out to their homes to do a BCI home audit. Because one of the most revolutionary part about having this in one system that is completely wireless, is that you can use it at home. You don&#8217;t actually have to go to the lab and go to the clinic to get connectedorized to these specialized equipment that you can&#8217;t take home with you.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So that&#8217;s one of the key elements of when we&#8217;re designing the system that we wanted to keep in mind, people hopefully would want to be able to use this every day in the comfort of their homes.

            <span class="ts-text">And we should also step back and say that the estimate is 180,000 people live with quadriplegia in the United States, and each year an additional 18,000 suffer a paralyzing spinal cord injury. So these are folks who have a lot of challenges living a life in terms of accessibility, in terms of doing the things that many of us just take for granted day to day.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And one of the things, one of the goals of this initial study is to enable them to have digital autonomy where they by themselves can interact with a digital device using just their mind, something that you&#8217;re calling telepathy, so digital telepathy. Where a quadriplegic can communicate with a digital device in all the ways that we&#8217;ve been talking about. Control the mouse cursor enough to be able to do all kinds of stuff, including play games and tweet and all that kind of stuff.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I mean, movement is so fundamental to our existence. I mean, even speaking involves movement of mouth, lip, larynx. And without that, it&#8217;s extremely debilitating. And there are many, many people that we can help. I mean, especially if you start to look at other forms of movement disorders that are not just from spinal cord injury, but from a ALS, MS, or even stroke, or just aging, that leads you to lose some of that mobility, that independence, it&#8217;s extremely debilitating.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so the first one you&#8217;re focusing on is, it&#8217;s just a beautiful word, telepathy. So being able to communicate using your mind wirelessly with a digital device. Can you just explain exactly what we&#8217;re talking about?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s exactly that. I mean, I think if you are able to control a cursor and able to click and be able to get access to a computer or a phone, I mean, the whole world opens up to you. And I mean, I guess the word &#8220;telepathy,&#8221; if you think about that as just definitionally being able to transfer information from my brain to your brain without using some of the physical faculties that we have, like voices.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But the interesting thing here is I think the thing that&#8217;s not obviously clear is how exactly it works. In order to move a cursor, there&#8217;s at least a couple of ways of doing that. One is you imagine yourself maybe moving a mouse with your hand, or you can then, which no one talked about, imagine moving the cursor with your mind.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But it&#8217;s like there is a cognitive step here that&#8217;s fascinating, because you have to use the brain and you have to learn how to use the brain, and you have to figure it out dynamically because you reward yourself if it works. I mean, there&#8217;s a step that &#8230; This is just a fascinating step because you have to get the brain to start firing in the right way. And you do that by imagining &#8230; Like fake it till you make it. And all of a sudden it creates the right kind of signal that, if decoded correctly, can create the effect. And then there&#8217;s noise around that that you have to figure all of that out. But on the human side, imagine the cursor moving is what you have to do.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The force. I mean, isn&#8217;t that just fascinating to you that it works? To me, it&#8217;s like, holy shit, that actually works. You could move a cursor with your mind.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">As much as you&#8217;re learning to use that thing, that thing is also learning about you.

            <span class="ts-text">So the machine is learning about the human and the human is learning about the machine, so there is a adaptability to the signal process and the decoding step, and then there&#8217;s the adaptation of Nolan, the human being. The same way, if you give me a new mouse and I move it, I learn very quickly about its sensitivity, so I learn to move it slower. And then there&#8217;s other signal drift and all that kind of stuff they have to adapt to, so both are adapting to each other.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The organic and the inorganic. Anyway. Sorry to rudely interrupt. So there&#8217;s the selection that Noland has passed with flying colors. Everything, including that it is a BCI-friendly home, all of that. So what is the process of the surgery, implantation, the first moment when he gets to use the system?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=9066">(02:31:06)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">The end-to-end, we say patient end to patient out, is anywhere between two to four hours. In the particular case for Noland it was about three and a half hours, and there&#8217;s many steps leading to the actual robot insertion. So there&#8217;s anesthesia induction, and we do intra-op CT imaging to make sure that we&#8217;re drilling the hole in the right location. And this is also pre-planned beforehand.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">Someone like Noland would go through fMRI and then they can think about wiggling their hand. Obviously due to their injury it&#8217;s not going to actually lead to any sort of intended output, but it&#8217;s the same part of the brain that actually lights up when you&#8217;re imagining moving your finger to actually moving your finger. And that&#8217;s one of the ways in which we can actually know where to place our threads because we want to go into what&#8217;s called the hand knob area in the motor cortex. And as much as possible, densely put our electrode threads.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So we do intra-op CT imaging to make sure and double-check the location of the craniectomy. And the surgeon comes in, does their thing in terms of skin incision, craniectomy, so drilling of the skull, and then there&#8217;s many different layers of the brain. There&#8217;s what&#8217;s called a dura, which is a very, very thick layer that surrounds the brain. That gets actually resected in a process called [inaudible 02:32:38]. And that then expose the pia in the brain that you want to insert.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And by the time it&#8217;s been around anywhere between one to one and a half hours, robot comes in, does his thing, placement of the targets, inserting of the thread. That takes anywhere between 20 to 40 minutes. In the particular case for Noland, it was just under or just over 30 minutes. And then after that, the surgeon comes in, there&#8217;s a couple other steps of actually inserting the dural substitute layer to protect the thread as well as the brain. And then screw in the implant and then skin flap and then suture, and then you&#8217;re out.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So when Noland woke up, what was that like? What was the recovery like, and when was the first time he was able to use it?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">He was actually immediately after the surgery, like an hour after the surgery, as he was waking up, we did turn on the device, make sure that we are recording neural signals. And we actually did have couple signals that we noticed that he can actually modulate. And what I mean by modulate is that he can think about clenching his fist and you could see the spike disappear and appear.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s a human being &#8230; I mean, what did that feel like for you? This device and a human being, a first step of a gigantic journey? I mean, it&#8217;s a historic moment, even just that spike, just to be able to modulate that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Obviously there have been other, as you mentioned, pioneers that have participated in these groundbreaking BCI investigational early feasibility studies.

            <span class="ts-text">But I mean, just leading up to the surgery, I definitely could not sleep. It&#8217;s the first time that you&#8217;re working in a completely new environment. We had a lot of confidence based on our benchtop testing or preclinical R&#038;D studies that the mechanism, the threads, the insertion, all that stuff is very safe and that it&#8217;s obviously ready for doing this in a human. But there&#8217;s still a lot of unknown unknown about can the needle actually insert? I mean, we brought something like 40 needles just in case they break, and we ended up using only one. But I mean, that was the level of just complete unknown because it&#8217;s a very, very different environment. And I mean, that&#8217;s why we do clinical trial in the first place, to be able to test these things out.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So extreme nervousness and just many, many sleepless night leading up to the surgery, and definitely the day before the surgery. And it was an early morning surgery. We started at 7:00 in the morning, and by the time it was around 10:30 everything was done. But I mean, first time seeing that, well, number one, just huge relief that this thing is doing what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And two, I mean, just immense amount of gratitude for Noland and his family. And then many others that have applied and that we&#8217;ve spoken to and will speak to are true pioneers in every word. And I call them the neural astronauts or neuralnaut.</span>

And then maybe expand the realm of the possible for the human mind for millions of people in the future. So it&#8217;s really exciting. The opportunities are all ahead of us, and to do that safely and to do that effectively was really fun to see.

            <span class="ts-text">Speaking of challenges, Neuralink published a blog post describing that some of the threads retracted. And so the performance as measured by bits per second dropped at first, but then eventually it was regained. And the whole story of how it was regained is super interesting, that&#8217;s definitely something I&#8217;ll talk to Bliss and to Noland about.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The main takeaway is that in the end, the performance have come back and it&#8217;s actually gotten better than it was before.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, better than before. That&#8217;s a story on its own of what took the BCI team to recover that performance. It was actually mostly on the signal processing. And so as I mentioned, we were looking at these spike outputs from our electrodes, and what happened is that four weeks into the surgery we noticed that the threads have solely come out of the brain. And the way in which we noticed this at first obviously is that, well, I think Noland was the first to notice, that his performance was degrading. And I think at the time we were also trying to do a bunch of different experimentation, different algorithms, different UI, UX. So it was expected that there will be variability in the performance, but we did see a steady decline.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then also the way in which we measure the health of the electrodes or whether they&#8217;re in the brain or not, is by measuring impedance of the electrode. So we look at the interfacial, the Randles circuit they say, the capacitance and the resistance between the electrode surface and the medium. And if that changes in some dramatic ways, we have some indication. Or if you&#8217;re not seeing spikes on those channels, you have some indications that something&#8217;s happening there.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=9671">(02:41:11)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And what we noticed is that looking at those impedance plot and spike rate plots, and also because we have those electrodes recording along the depth, you are seeing some sort of movement that indicated that threads were being pulled out. And that obviously will have an implication on the model side because if the number of inputs that are going into the model is changing because you have less of them, that model needs to get updated.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=9702">(02:41:42)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">But there were still signals, and as I mentioned, similar to how even when you place the signals on the surface of the brain or farther away, like outside the skull, you still see some useful signals. What we started looking at is not just the spike occurrence through this BOSS algorithm that I mentioned, but we started looking at just the power of the frequency band that is interesting for Noland to be able to modulate. Once we changed the algorithm for the implant to not just give you the BOSS output, but also these spike band power output, that helped us refine the model with a new set of inputs. And that was the thing that really ultimately gave us the performance back. And obviously the thing that we want ultimately and the thing that we are working towards, is figuring out ways in which we can keep those threads intact for as long as possible so that we have many more channels going into the model. That&#8217;s by far the number one priority that the team is currently embarking on to understand how to prevent that from happening.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">The thing that I will say also is that, as I mentioned, this is the first time ever that we&#8217;re putting these threads in the human brain. And a human brain, just for size reference, is 10 times that of the monkey brain or the sheep brain. And it&#8217;s just a very, very different environment. It moves a lot more. It&#8217;s actually moved a lot more than we expected when we did Noland&#8217;s surgery. And it&#8217;s just a very, very different environment than what we&#8217;re used to. And this is why we do clinical trial, we want to uncover some of these issues and failure modes earlier than later.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So in many ways, it&#8217;s provided us with this enormous amount of data and information to be able to solve this. And this is something that Neuralink is extremely good at, once we have set of clear objective and engineering problem, we have enormous amount of talents across many, many disciplines to be able to come together and fix the problem very, very quickly.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But it sounds like one of the fascinating challenges here is for the system on the decoding side to be adaptable across different timescales. So whether it&#8217;s movement of threads or different aspects of signal drift, sort of on the software or the human brain, something changing, like Noland talks about cursor drift, they could be corrected. And there&#8217;s a whole UX challenge to how to do that. So it sounds like adaptability is a fundamental property that has to be engineered in.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Okay. What are we looking at here, this thing? &#8220;In less than one minute, our custom-made femtosecond laser mill cuts this geometry in the tips of our needles.&#8221; So we&#8217;re looking at this weirdly shaped needle. &#8220;The tip is only 10 to 12 microns in width, only slightly larger than the diameter of a red blood cell. The small size allows threads to be inserted with minimal damage to the cortex.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">This is the needle that&#8217;s engaging with the loops in the thread. They&#8217;re the ones that thread their loop, and then peel it from the silicon backing, and then this is the thing that gets inserted into the tissue. And then this pulls out, leaving the thread. And this kind of a notch or the shark tooth that we used to call, is the thing that actually is grasping the loop. And then it&#8217;s designed in such a way such that when you pull out, it leaves the loop.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. So this is actually housed in a cannula, and basically the robot has a lot of the optics that look for where the loop is. There&#8217;s actually a 405 nanometer light that actually causes the polyimide to fluoresce so that you can locate the location of the loop.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, our robot is quite heavy, our current version of it. I mean, it&#8217;s like a giant granite slab that weighs about a ton, because it needs to be sensitive to vibration, environmental vibration. And then as the head is moving at the speed that it&#8217;s moving, there&#8217;s a lot of motion control to make sure that you can achieve that level of precision. A lot of optics that zoom in on that. We&#8217;re working on next generation of the robot that is lighter, easier to transport. I mean, it is a feat to move the robot to the surgical suite.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So continuing the paragraph. &#8220;We developed novel hardware and software testing systems, such as our accelerated lifetime testing racks and simulated surgery environment,&#8221; which is pretty cool, &#8220;to stress test and validate the robustness of our technologies. We performed many rehearsals of our surgeries to refine our procedures and make them second nature.&#8221; This is pretty cool.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8220;We practice surgeries on proxies with all the hardware and instruments needed in our mock or in the engineering space. This helps us rapidly test and measure.&#8221; So there&#8217;s like proxies?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, this proxy is super cool actually.

            <span class="ts-text">Basically what we&#8217;re talking about here, and there&#8217;s a lot of work that has gone into making this set proxy, that it&#8217;s about finding the right concentration of these different synthetic polymers to get the right set of consistency for the needle dynamics as they&#8217;re being inserted.

            <span class="ts-text">At the end of the day, the gold standard is to look at the tissue. What sort of trauma did you cause the tissue, and does that correlate to whatever behavioral anomalies that you may have seen? And that&#8217;s the language to which we can communicate about the safety of inserting something into the brain and what type of trauma that you can cause.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">We actually have an entire department, department of pathology, that looks at these tissue slices. There are many steps that are involved in doing this. Once you have studies that are launched with particular endpoints in mind, at some point you have to euthanize the animal, and then you go through necropsy to collect the brain tissue samples. You fix them in formalin, and you gross them, you section them, and you look at individual slices just to see what kind of reaction or lack thereof exists.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So that&#8217;s the language to which FDA speaks and as well for us to evaluate the safety of the insertion mechanism, as well as the threats at various different time points, both acute, so anywhere between zero to three months to beyond three months.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The FDA supervises this, but there&#8217;s in general just a very high standard, in every aspect of this, including the surgery. I think Matthew MacDougall has mentioned that the standard is, let&#8217;s say how to put it politely, higher than maybe some other operations that we take for granted. So the standard for all the surgical stuff here is extremely high.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Very high. I mean, it&#8217;s a highly, highly regulated environment with the governing agencies that scrutinize every, every medical device that gets marketed. And I think it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s good to have those high standards, and we try to hold extremely high standards to understand what sort of damage, if any, these innovative emerging technologies and new technologies that we&#8217;re building are. And so far we have been extremely impressed by lack of immune response from these threads.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Speaking of which, you talked to me with excitement about the histology in some of the images that you&#8217;re able to share. Can you explain to me what we&#8217;re looking at?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so what you&#8217;re looking at is a stained tissue image. This is a sectioned tissue slice from an animal that was implanted for seven months, so a chronic time point. And you&#8217;re seeing all these different colors, and each color indicates specific types of cell types. So purple and pink are astrocytes and microglia, respectably. They&#8217;re types of glial cells.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the other thing that people may not be aware of is your brain is not just made up of soup of neurons and axons. There are other cells, like glial cells, that actually is the glue and also react if there are any trauma or damage to the tissue.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So what you&#8217;re seeing is in this macro image, you&#8217;re seeing these circle highlighted in white, the insertion sites. And when you zoom into one of those, you see the threads. And then in this particular case, I think we&#8217;re seeing about the 16 wires that are going into the [inaudible 02:54:56]. And the incredible thing here is the fact that you have the neurons that are these brown structures or brown circular or elliptical thing-</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=10500">(02:55:00)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; are these brown structures or brown circular or elliptical thing that are actually touching and abutting the threads. So what this is saying is that there&#8217;s basically zero trauma that&#8217;s caused during this insertion. And with these neural interfaces, these micro electrons that you insert, that is one of the most common mode of failure. So when you insert these threads like the Utah Array, it causes neuronal death around the site because you&#8217;re inserting a foreign object.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And that elicit these immune response through microglia and astrocytes, they form this protective layer around it. Oh, not only are you killing the neuron cells, but you&#8217;re also creating this protective layer that then basically prevents you from recording neural signals because you&#8217;re getting further and further away from the neurons that you&#8217;re trying to record. And that is the biggest mode of failure. And in this particular example, in that inside it&#8217;s about 50 micron with that scale bar, the neurons seem to be attracted to it.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so there&#8217;s certainly no trauma. That&#8217;s such a beautiful image, by the way. So the brown at the neurons, and for some reason I can&#8217;t look away. It&#8217;s really cool.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. And the way that these things&#8230; Tissues generally don&#8217;t have these beautiful colors. This is multiplex stain that uses these different proteins that are staining these at different colors. We use very standard set of staining techniques with H&#038;E, EVA1 and NeuN and GFAB. So if you go to the next image, this is also kind of illustrates the second point because you can make an argument, and initially when we saw the previous image, we said, &#8220;Oh, are the threads just floating? What is happening here? Are we actually looking at the right thing?&#8221; So what we did is we did another stain, and this is all done in-house of this Masson&#8217;s tricrome stain, which is in blue that shows these collagen layer. So the blue, basically, you don&#8217;t want the blue around the implant threads. Because that means that there&#8217;s some sort of scarring that&#8217;s happened. And what you&#8217;re seeing if you look at individual threads is that you don&#8217;t see any of the blue. Which means that there has been absolutely, or very, very minimal to a point where it&#8217;s not detectable amount of trauma in these inserted threads.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So that presumably is one of the big benefits of having this kind of flexible thread? This-</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So we think this is primarily due to the size as well as the flexibility of the threads. Also, the fact that R1 is avoiding vasculature, so we&#8217;re not disrupting or we&#8217;re not causing damage to the vessels and not breaking any of the blood brain barrier, has basically caused the immune response to be muted.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But this is also a nice illustration of the size of things. So this is the tip of the thread?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, those are neurons.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And they&#8217;re neurons. And this is the thread listening. And the electrodes are positioned how?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So what you&#8217;re looking at is not electrode themselves, those are the conductive wires. So each of those should probably be two micron in width. So what we&#8217;re looking at is, we&#8217;re looking at the coronal slice, so we&#8217;re looking at some slice of the tissue. So as you go deeper, you&#8217;ll obviously have less and less of the tapering of the thread. But yeah, the point basically being that there&#8217;s just cells around the inserter site, which is just an incredible thing to see. I&#8217;ve just never seen anything like this.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so it depends on when. In the first three months or so after the surgery, there&#8217;s a lot of tissue modeling that&#8217;s happening. Similar to when you got a cut, you obviously start over first couple of weeks or depending on the size of the wound, scar tissue forming, there are these contractive, and then in the end they turn into scab and you can scab it off. The same thing happens in the brain. And it&#8217;s a very dynamic environment. And before the scar tissue or the neo membrane or the new membrane that forms, it&#8217;s quite easy to just pull them out. And there&#8217;s minimal trauma that&#8217;s caused during that.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">Once the scar tissue forms, and with Noland as well, we believe that that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s currently anchoring the threats. So we haven&#8217;t seen any more movements since then. So they&#8217;re quite stable. It gets harder to actually completely extract the threads. So our current method for removing the device is cutting the thread, leaving the tissue intact, and then unscrewing and taking the implant out. And that hole is now going to be plugged with either another Neuralink or just with a peak based, plastic based cap.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Is it okay to leave the threads in there forever?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, we think so. We&#8217;ve done studies where we left them there and one of the biggest concerns that we had is, do they migrate and do they get to a point where they should not be? We haven&#8217;t seen that. Again. Once the scar tissue forms, they get anchored in place. And I should also say that when we say upgrades, we&#8217;re not just talking in theory here, we&#8217;ve actually upgraded many, many times. Most of our monkeys or non-human primates, NHP, have been upgraded. Pager, who you saw playing mind pong has the latest version of the device since two years ago and is seemingly very happy and healthy and fat.</span>
        </div>
        
                <h2 id="chapter25_upgrades">Upgrades</h2>

            <span class="ts-text">So what&#8217;s designed for the future, the upgrade procedure? So maybe for Noland, what would the upgrade look like? It was essentially what you&#8217;re mentioning. Is there a way to upgrade the device internally where you take it apart and keep the capsule and upgrade the internals?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">DJ Seo</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there are a couple of different things here. So for Noland, if we were to upgrade, what we would have to do is either cut the threads or extract the threads depending on the situation there in terms of how they&#8217;re anchored or scarred in. If you were to remove them with the dual substitute, you have an intact brain, so you can reinsert different threads with the updated implant package. There are a couple of different other ways that we&#8217;re thinking about the future of what the upgradable system looks like. One is, at the moment we currently remove the dura, this kind of thick layer that protects the brain, but that actually is the thing that actually proliferates the scar tissue formation. So typically, the general rule of thumb is you want to leave the nature as is and not disrupt it as much. So looking at ways to insert the threats through the dura, which comes with different set of challenges such as, it&#8217;s a pretty thick layer, so how do you actually penetrate that without breaking the needle?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So we&#8217;re looking at different needle design for that as well as the kind of the loop engagement. The other biggest challenges are, it&#8217;s quite opaque, optically with white light illumination. So how do you avoid still this biggest advantage that we have of avoiding vasculature? How do you image through that? How do you actually still mediate that? So there are other imaging techniques that we&#8217;re looking at to enable that. But the goal, our hypothesis is that, and based on some of the early evidence that we have, doing through the dura insertion will cause minimal scarring that causes them to be much easier to extract over time. And the other thing that we&#8217;re also looking at, this is going to be a fundamental change in the implant architecture, is as at the moment, it&#8217;s a monolithic single implant that comes with a thread that&#8217;s bonded together.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So you can&#8217;t actually separate the thing out, but you can imagine having two part implant, bottom part that is the thread that are inserted that has the chips and maybe a radio and some power source. And then you have another implant that has more of the computational heavy load and the bigger battery. And then one can be under the dura, one can be above the dura being the plug for the skull. They can talk to each other, but the thing that you want to upgrade, the computer and not the thread, if you want to upgrade that, you just go in there, remove the screws, and then put in the next version. And you&#8217;re off the&#8230; It&#8217;s a very, very easy surgery too. You do a skin incision, slip this in, screw. Probably be able to do this in 10 minutes.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So I mean, this leads to the natural question of what is the pathway to scaling the increase in the number of threads? Is that a priority? What&#8217;s the technical challenge there?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, that is a priority. So for next versions of the implant, the key metrics that we&#8217;re looking to improve are number of channels, just recording from more and more neurons. We have a pathway to actually go from currently 1000 to hopefully 3000, if not 6,000 by end of this year.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s a couple of limitations to that. One is, obviously being able to photolithographically, print those wires. As I mentioned, it&#8217;s two micron in width and spacing. Obviously, there are chips that are much more advanced than those types of resolution and we have some of the tools that we have brought in house to be able to do that. So traces will be narrower just so that you have to have more of the wires coming up into the chip. Chips also cannot linearly consume more energy as you have more and more channels. So there&#8217;s a lot of innovations in the circuit, and architecture as well as the circuit design topology to make them lower power. You need to also think about if you have all of these spikes, how do you send that off to the end application. So you need to think about bandwidth limitation there and potentially innovations and signal processing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Physically, one of the biggest challenges is going to be the interface. It&#8217;s always the interface that breaks bonding this thin film array to the electronics. It starts to become very, very highly dense interconnects. So how you connectivise that? There&#8217;s a lot of innovations in the 3D integrations in the recent years that we can take advantage of. One of the biggest challenges that we do have is forming this hermetic barrier. This is an extremely harsh environment that we&#8217;re in, the brain. So how do you protect it from, yeah, the brain trying to kill your electronics, to also your electronics leaking things that you don&#8217;t want into the brain. And that forming that hermetic barrier is going to be a very, very big challenge that we, I think are actually well suited to tackle.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so this is where the accelerated life tester essentially is a brain in a vat. It literally is a vessel that is made up of, and again, for all intents and purpose for this particular type of test, your brain is a salt water. And you can also put some other set of chemicals like reactive oxygen species that get at these interfaces and trying to cause a reaction to pull it apart. But you could also increase the rate at which these interfaces are aging by just increasing temperature. So every 10 degrees Celsius that you increase, you&#8217;re basically accelerating time by two X.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And there&#8217;s limit as to how much temperature you want to increase because at some point there&#8217;s some other nonlinear dynamics that causes you to have other nasty gases to form that just is not realistic in an environment. So what we do is we increase in our ALT chamber by 20 degrees Celsius that increases the aging by four times. So essentially one day in ALT chamber is four day in calendar year, and we look at whether the implants still are intact, including the threats. And-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; and operation and all of that. Obviously, is not an exact same environment as a brain because brain has mechanical other more biological groups that attack at it. But it is a good test environment, testing environment for at least the enclosure and the strength of the enclosure. And I mean, we&#8217;ve had implants, the current version of the implant that has been in there for close to two and a half years, which is equivalent to a decade and they seem to be fine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">By the way, the other thing that also is interesting about our enclosure is, if you look at our implant, it&#8217;s not your common looking medical implant that usually is encased in a titanium can that&#8217;s laser welded. We use this polymer called PCTFE, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, which is actually commonly used in blister packs. So when you have a pill and you try to pop a pill, there&#8217;s kind of that plastic membrane. That&#8217;s what this is. No one&#8217;s actually ever used this except us. And the reason we wanted to do this is because electromagnetically transparent. So when we talked about the electromagnetic inductive charging, with titanium can usually if you want to do something like that, you have to have a sapphire window and it&#8217;s a very, very tough process to scale.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Absolutely. That&#8217;s the goal. And we talk about at Neuralink building a generalized neural interface to the brain. And that also is strategically how we&#8217;re approaching this with marketing and also with regulatory, which is, hey, look, we have the robot and the robot can access any part of the cortex. Right now we&#8217;re focused on motor cortex with current version of the N1 that&#8217;s specialized for motor decoding tasks. But also at the end of the day, there&#8217;s a general compute available there. But typically if you want to really get down to hyperoptimizing for power and efficiency, you do need to get to some specialized function.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But what we&#8217;re saying is that, hey, you are now used to this robotic insertion techniques, which took many, many years of showing data and conversation with the FDA and also internally convincing ourselves that this is safe. And now the difference is if we go to other parts of the brain, like visual cortex, which we&#8217;re interested in as our second product, obviously it&#8217;s a completely different environment, the cortex is laid out very, very differently. It&#8217;s going to be more stimulation focus rather than recording, just kind of creating visual percepts. But in the end, we&#8217;re using the same thin film array technology, we&#8217;re using the same robot insertion technology, we&#8217;re using the same packaging technology. Now it&#8217;s where the conversation is focused around what are the differences and what are the implication of those differences in safety and efficacy.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I guess I&#8217;ll start by saying that we actually have been capable of stimulating through our thin film array as well as other electronics for years. We have actually demonstrated some of that capabilities for reanimating the limb in the spinal cord. Obviously, for the current EFS study, we&#8217;ve hardware disabled that. So that&#8217;s something that we wanted to embark as a separate journey. And obviously, there are many, many different ways to write information into the brain. The way in which we&#8217;re doing that is through electrical, passing electrical current, and kind of causing that to really change the local environment so that you can artificially cause the neurons to depolarize in nearby areas. For vision, specifically the way our visual system works, it&#8217;s both well understood. I mean, anything with kind of brain, there are aspects of it that&#8217;s well understood, but in the end, we don&#8217;t really know anything.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But the way visual system works is that you have photon hitting your eye, and in your eyes there are these specialized cells called photoreceptor cells that convert the photon energy into electrical signals. And then that then gets projected to your back of your head, your visual cortex. It goes through actually thalamic system called LGN that then projects it out. And then in the visual cortex there&#8217;s visual area one or V1, and then there&#8217;s a bunch of other higher level processing layers like V2, V3. And there are actually kind of interesting parallels. And when you study the behaviors of these convolutional neural networks, like what the different layers of the network is detecting, first they&#8217;re detecting these edges and they&#8217;re then detecting some more natural curves and then they start to detect objects.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Kind of similar thing happens in the brain. And a lot of that has been inspired and also it&#8217;s been kind of exciting to see some of the correlations there. But things like from there, where does cognition arise and where&#8217;s color encoded? There&#8217;s just not a lot of understanding, fundamental understanding there. So in terms of bringing sight back to those that are blind, there are many different forms of blindness. There&#8217;s actually million people, 1 million people in the US that are legally blind. That means certain score below in the visual tests. I think it&#8217;s something like if you can see something at 20 feet distance that normal people can see at 200 feet distance, if you&#8217;re worse than that, you&#8217;re legally blind.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; you&#8217;re environment. And yeah, there are different forms of blindness. There are forms of blindness where there&#8217;s some degeneration of your retina is photoreceptor cells and rest of your visual processing that I described is intact. And for those types of individuals, you may not need to maybe stick electrodes into the visual cortex. You can actually build retinal prosthetic devices that actually just replaces the function of that retinal cells that are degenerated. And there are many companies that are working on that, but that&#8217;s a very small slice albeit significance, those smaller slice of folks that are legally blind.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">If there&#8217;s any damage along that circuitry, whether it&#8217;s in the optic nerve or just the LGN circuitry or any break in that circuit, that&#8217;s not going to work for you. And the source of where you need to actually cause that visual percepts to happen because your biological mechanism not doing that is by placing electrodes in the visual cortex in the back of your head. And the way in which this would work is that you would have an external camera, whether it&#8217;s something as unsophisticated as a GoPro or some sort of wearable Ray- Ban type glasses that meta is working on that captures a scene. And that scene is then converted to a set of electrical impulses or stimulation pulses that you would activate in your visual cortex through these thin film arrays. And by playing some a concerted kind of orchestra of these stimulation patterns, you can create what&#8217;s called phosphenes, which are these kind of white yellowish dots that you can also create by just pressing your eyes. You can actually create those percepts by stimulating the visual cortex.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the name of the game is really have many of those and have those percepts, be the phosphenes, be as small as possible so that you can start to tell apart they&#8217;re the individual pixels of the screen. So if you have many, many of those potentially you&#8217;ll be able to, in the long term, be able to actually get naturalistic vision. But in the short term to maybe midterm, being able to at least, be able to have object detection algorithms run on your glasses, the pre-processing units, and then being able to at least see the edges of things so you don&#8217;t bump into stuff.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">This is incredible. This is really incredible. So you basically would be adding pixels and your brain would start to figure out what those pixels mean with different kinds of assistant signal processing on all fronts.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. The thing that actually&#8230; So a couple of things. One is obviously if you&#8217;re blind from birth, the way brain works, especially in the early age, neuroplasticity is really nothing other than your brain and different parts of your brain fighting for the limited territory. And I mean very, very quickly you see cases where people that are&#8230; I mean, you also hear about people who are blind that have heightened sense of hearing or some other senses. And the reason for that is because that cortex that&#8217;s not used just gets taken over by these different parts of the cortex. So for those types of individuals, I mean I guess they&#8217;re going to have to now map some other parts of their senses into what they call vision, but it&#8217;s going to be obviously a very, very different conscious experience.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Before&#8230; So I think that&#8217;s an interesting caveat. The other thing that also is important to highlight is that, we&#8217;re currently limited by our biology in terms of the wavelength that we can see. There&#8217;s a very, very small wavelength that is a visible light wavelength that we can see with our eyes. But when you have an external camera with this BCI system, you&#8217;re not limited to that. You can have infrared, you can have UV, you can have whatever other spectrum that you want to see. And whether that gets matched to some sort of weird conscious experience, I&#8217;ve no idea. But oftentimes I talk to people about the goal of Neuralink being going beyond the limits of our biology. That&#8217;s sort of what I mean.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And if you&#8217;re able to control the kind of raw signal, is that when we use our site, we&#8217;re getting the photons and there&#8217;s not much processing on it. If you&#8217;re being able to control that signal, maybe you can do some kind of processing, maybe you do object detection ahead of time. You&#8217;re doing some kind of pre-processing and there&#8217;s a lot of possibilities to explore that. So it&#8217;s not just increasing thermal imaging, that kind of stuff, but it&#8217;s also just doing some kind of interesting processing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. Yeah. I mean, my theory of how visual system works also is that, I mean, there&#8217;s just so many things happening in the world and there&#8217;s a lot of photons that are going into your eye. And it&#8217;s unclear exactly where some of the pre-processing steps are happening. But I mean, I actually think that just from a fundamental perspective, there&#8217;s just so much the reality that we&#8217;re in, if it&#8217;s a reality, so there&#8217;s so much data and I think humans are just unable to actually eat enough, actually to process all that information. So there&#8217;s some sort of filtering that does happen, whether that happens in the retina, whether that happens in different layers of the visual cortex, unclear. But the analogy that I sometimes think about is, if your brain is a CCD camera and all of the information in the world is a sun, and when you try to actually look at the sun with the CCD camera, it&#8217;s just going to saturate the sensors because it&#8217;s an enormous amount of energy.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So what you do is you end up adding these filters to just kind of narrow the information that&#8217;s coming to you and being captured. And I think things like our experiences or our drugs like propofol, anesthetics drug or psychedelics, what they&#8217;re doing is they&#8217;re kind of swapping out these filters and putting in new ones or removing older ones and kind of controlling our conscious experience.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, man, not to distract from the topic, but I just took a very high dose of ayahuasca in the Amazon jungle. So yes, it&#8217;s a nice way to think about it. You&#8217;re swapping out different experiences and with Neuralink being able to control that, primarily at first to improve function, not for entertainment purposes or enjoyment purposes, but-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I mean the thing that also is hard to appreciate sometimes is that, he&#8217;s doing these things while talking. And I mean, it&#8217;s multitasking, so it&#8217;s clearly, it&#8217;s obviously cognitively intensive. But similar to how when we talk, we move our hands. These are multitasking. I mean, he&#8217;s able to do that. And you won&#8217;t be able to do that with other assistive technology. As far as I am aware, if you&#8217;re obviously using an eye tracking device, you&#8217;re very much fixated on that thing that you&#8217;re trying to do. And if you&#8217;re using voice control, I mean if you say some other stuff, you don&#8217;t get to use that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The multitasking aspect of that is really interesting. So it&#8217;s not just the BPS for the primary task, it&#8217;s the parallelization of multiple tasks. If you measure the BPS for the entirety of the human organism. So you&#8217;re talking and doing a thing with your mind and looking around also, I mean, there&#8217;s just a lot of parallelization that can be happening.</span>

That then is a much larger trial that starts to look at statistical significance of your endpoints and that&#8217;s required before you can then market the device. And that&#8217;s how it works in the US and just generally around the world. That&#8217;s the process you follow.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So our goal is to really just understand from people like Noland, P2, P3, future participants, what aspects of our device needs to improve. If it turns out that people are like, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t like the fact that it lasts only six hours. I want to be able to use this computer for 24 hours.&#8221; I mean, that is a user needs and user requirements, which we can only find out from just being able to engage with them.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So before the pivotal study, there&#8217;s kind of a rapid innovation based on individual experiences. You&#8217;re learning from individual people, how they use it, the high resolution details in terms of cursor control and signal and all that kind of stuff, life experience.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s hardware changes, but also just firmware updates. So even when we had that sort of recovery event for Noland, he now has the new firmware that he has been updated with, and similar to how your phones get updated all the time with new firmware for security patches, whatever, new functionality, UI. And that&#8217;s something that is possible with our implant. It&#8217;s not a static one-time device that can only do&#8230;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s not a static one-time device that can only do the thing that it said it can do. I mean, it&#8217;s similar to Tesla, you can do over-the-air firmware updates, and now you have completely new user interface and all these bells and whistles and improvements on everything, like the latest. Right? When we say generalized platform, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re talking about.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. It&#8217;s really cool how the app that Noland is using, there&#8217;s calibration, all that kind of stuff, and then there&#8217;s update. You just click and get an update.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">What other future capabilities are you looking to? You said vision. That&#8217;s a fascinating one. What about accelerated typing or speech, or this kind of stuff? And what else is there?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Those are still in the realm of movement program. So, largely speaking, we have two programs. We have the movement program and we have the vision program. The movement program currently is focused around the digital freedom. As you can easily guess, if you can control 2D cursor in the digital space, you could move anything in the physical space. So, robotic arms, wheelchair, your environment, or even really, whether it&#8217;s through the phone or just directly to those interfaces, to those machines.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So, we&#8217;re looking at ways to expand those types of capability, even for Noland. That requires conversation with the FDA and showing safety data for if there&#8217;s a robotic arm or a wheelchair, that we can guarantee that they&#8217;re not going to hurt themselves accidentally. Right? It&#8217;s very different if you&#8217;re moving stuff in the digital domain versus in the physical space, you can actually potentially cause harm to the participants. So, we&#8217;re working through that right now.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Speech does involve different areas of the brain. Speech prosthetic is very, very fascinating and there&#8217;s actually been a lot of really amazing work that&#8217;s been happening in academia. Sergey Stavisky at UC Davis, Jaimie Henderson and late Krishna Shenoy at Stanford, are doing just some incredible amount of work in improving speech neuro-prosthetics. And those are actually looking more at parts of the motor cortex that are controlling these vocal articulators, and being able to, even by mouthing the word or imagine speech, you can pick up those signals.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The more sophisticated higher level processing areas like the Broca&#8217;s area or Wernicke&#8217;s area, those are still very, very big mystery in terms of the underlying mechanism of how all that stuff works. But I mean, I think Neuralink&#8217;s eventual goal is to understand those things and be able to provide a platform and tools to be able to understand that and study that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">This is where I get to the pothead questions. Do you think we can start getting insight into things like thought? So, speech, there&#8217;s a muscular component, like you said, there&#8217;s the act of producing sounds, but then what about the internal things like cognition, like low-level thoughts and high-level thoughts? Do you think we&#8217;ll start noticing signals that could be picked up, they could be understood, that could be maybe used in order to interact with the outside world?</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">In some ways, I guess, this starts to kind of get into the hard problem of consciousness. And I mean, on one hand, all of these are at some point, set of electrical signals that from there maybe it in itself is giving you the cognition or the meaning, or somehow human mind is an incredibly amazing storytelling machine. So, we&#8217;re telling ourselves and fooling ourselves that there&#8217;s some interesting meaning here.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">But I mean, I certainly think that BCI &#8230; Really, BCI, at the end of the day is a set of tools that help you study the underlying mechanisms in a both local but also broader sense, and whether there&#8217;s some interesting patterns of electrical signal that means you&#8217;re thinking this versus &#8230; And you can either learn from many, many sets of data to correlate some of that and be able to do mind reading or not. I&#8217;m not sure.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">I certainly would not rule that out as a possibility, but I think BCI alone probably can&#8217;t do that. There&#8217;s probably additional set of tools and framework and also just hard problem of consciousness, at the end of the day, is rooted in this philosophical question of what is the meaning of it all? What&#8217;s the nature of our existence? Where&#8217;s the mind emerged from this complex network?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we do really think about BCI and what we&#8217;re building as a tool for understanding the mind, the brain. The only question that matters.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There actually is some biological existence proof of what it would take to kind of start to form some of these experiences that may be unique. If you actually look at every one of our brains, there are two hemispheres. There&#8217;s a left-sided brain, there&#8217;s a right-sided brain. And unless you have some other conditions, you normally don&#8217;t feel like left legs or right legs, you just feel like one legs, right? So, what is happening there? Right?</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">If you actually look at the two hemispheres, there&#8217;s a structure that kind of connectorized the two, called the corpus callosum, that is supposed to have around 200 to 300 million connections or axons. So, whether that means that&#8217;s the number of interface and electrodes that we need to create some sort of mind meld or from that whatever new conscious experience that you can experience. But I do think that there&#8217;s kind of an interesting existence proof that we all have.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then, you&#8217;d be continuously pleasantly surprised. Do you see a world where there is millions of people, like tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people walking around with a Neuralink device or multiple Neuralink devices in their brain?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I do. First of all, there are, if you look at worldwide, people suffering from movement disorders and visual deficits, I mean, that&#8217;s in the tens if not hundreds of millions of people. So, that alone, I think there&#8217;s a lot of benefit and potential good that we can do with this type of technology. And once you start to get into psychiatric application, depression, anxiety, hunger or obesity, right? Mood, control of appetite. I mean, that starts to become very real to everyone.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Not to mention that most people on Earth have a smartphone, and once BCI starts competing with a smartphone as a preferred methodology of interacting with the digital world, that also becomes an interesting thing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Oh yeah, this is even before going to that, right? There&#8217;s almost, I mean, the entire world that could benefit from these types of things. And then, if we&#8217;re talking about next generation of how we interface with machines or even ourselves, in many ways, I think BCI can play a role in that. And some of the things that I also talk about is, I do think that there is a real possibility that you could see 8 billion people walking around with Neuralink.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Since forever. As far back as I can remember, I&#8217;ve been interested in the human brain. I mean, I was a thoughtful kid and a bit of an outsider, and you sit there thinking about what the most important things in the world are in your little tiny adolescent brain. And the answer that I came to, that I converged on was that all of the things you can possibly conceive of as things that are important for human beings to care about are literally contained in the skull. Both the perception of them and their relative values and the solutions to all our problems, and all of our problems, are all contained in the skull. And if we knew more about how that worked, how the brain encodes information and generates desires and generates agony and suffering, we could do more about it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You think about all the really great triumphs in human history. You think about all the really horrific tragedies. You think about the Holocaust, you think about any prison full of human stories, and all of those problems boil down to neurochemistry. So, if you get a little bit of control over that, you provide people the option to do better. In the way I read history, the way people have dealt with having better tools is that they most often, in the end, do better, with huge asterisks. But I think it&#8217;s an interesting, a worthy, a noble pursuit to give people more options, more tools.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, that&#8217;s a fascinating way to look at human history. You just imagine all these neurobiological mechanisms, Stalin, Hitler, Genghis Khan, all of them just had a brain, just a bunch of neurons, few times of billions of neurons gaining a bunch of information over a period of time. They have a set of modules that does language and memory and all that. And from there, in the case of those people, they&#8217;re able to murder millions of people. And all that coming from &#8230; There&#8217;s not some glorified notion of a dictator of this enormous mind or something like this. It&#8217;s just the brain.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. And so, I always find it interesting to look to primatology, look to our closest non-human relatives for clues as to how humans are going to behave and what particular humans are able to achieve. And so, you look at chimpanzees and bonobos, and they&#8217;re similar but different in their social structures particularly. And I went to Emory in Atlanta and studied under the great Frans de Waal, who was kind of the leading primatologist, who recently died. And his work looking at chimps through the lens of how you would watch an episode of Friends and understand the motivations of the characters interacting with each other. He would look at a chimp colony and basically apply that lens. I&#8217;m massively oversimplifying it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">If you do that, instead of just saying, &#8220;Subject 473 threw his feces at subject 471.&#8221; You talk about them in terms of their human struggles, accord them the dignity of themselves as actors with understandable goals and drives, what they want out of life. And primarily, it&#8217;s the things we want out of life, food, sex, companionship, power. You can understand chimp and bonobo behavior in the same lights much more easily. And I think doing so gives you the tools you need to reduce human behavior from the kind of false complexity that we layer onto it with language, and look at it in terms of, oh, well, these humans are looking for companionship, sex, food, power. And I think that that&#8217;s a pretty powerful tool to have in understanding human behavior.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I just went to the Amazon jungle for a few weeks and it&#8217;s a very visceral reminder that a lot of life on Earth is just trying to get laid. They&#8217;re all screaming at each other. I saw a lot of monkeys and they&#8217;re just trying to impress each other, or maybe if there&#8217;s a battle for power, but a lot of the battle for power has to do with them getting laid.</span>

            <span class="ts-name">Matthew MacDougall</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Basically, the moment I got to college, I started looking around for labs that I could do neuroscience work in. I originally approached that from the angle of looking at interactions between the brain and the immune system, which isn&#8217;t the most obvious place to start, but I had this idea at the time that the contents of your thoughts would have a direct impact, maybe a powerful one, on non-conscious systems in your body. The systems we think of as homeostatic automatic mechanisms, like fighting off a virus, like repairing a wound. And sure enough, there are big crossovers between the two.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">I mean, it gets to kind of a key point that I think goes under-recognized. One of the things people don&#8217;t recognize or appreciate about the human brain enough, and that is that it basically controls or has a huge role in almost everything that your body does. You try to name an example of something in your body that isn&#8217;t directly controlled or massively influenced by the brain, and it&#8217;s pretty hard. I mean, you might say like bone healing or something. But even those systems, the hypothalamus and pituitary end up playing a role in coordinating the endocrine system, that does have a direct influence on say, the calcium level in your blood, that goes to bone healing. So, non-obvious connections between those things implicate the brain as really a potent prime mover in all of health.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">One of the things I realized in the other direction too, how most of the systems in the body are integrated with the human brain, they affect the brain also, like the immune system. I think there&#8217;s just, people who study Alzheimer&#8217;s and those kinds of things, it&#8217;s just surprising how much you can understand of that from the immune system, from the other systems that don&#8217;t obviously seem to have anything to do with the nervous system. They all play together.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, you could understand how that would be driven by evolution too. Just in some simple examples, if you get sick, if you get a communicable disease, you get the flu, it&#8217;s pretty advantageous for your immune system to tell your brain, &#8220;Hey, now be antisocial for a few days. Don&#8217;t go be the life of the party tonight. In fact, maybe just cuddle up somewhere warm, under a blanket, and just stay there for a day or two.&#8221; And sure enough, that tends to be the behavior that you see both in animals and in humans. If you get sick, elevated levels of interleukins in your blood and TNF-alpha in your blood, ask the brain to cut back on social activity and even moving around, you have lower locomotor activity in animals that are infected with viruses.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, from there, the early days in neuroscience to surgery, when did that step happen? Which is a leap.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Matthew MacDougall</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. It was sort of an evolution of thought. I wanted to study the brain. I started studying the brain in undergrad in this neuroimmunology lab. I, from there, realized at some point that I didn&#8217;t want to just generate knowledge. I wanted to affect real changes in the actual world, in actual people&#8217;s lives. And so, after having not really thought about going into medical school, I was on a track to go into a PhD program. I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;d like that option. I&#8217;d like to actually potentially help tangible people in front of me.&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And doing a little digging, found that there exists these MD-PhD programs where you can choose not to choose between them and do both. And so, I went to USC for medical school and had a joint PhD program with Caltech, where I actually chose that program particularly because of a researcher at Caltech named Richard Andersen, who&#8217;s one of the godfathers of primate neuroscience, and has a macaque lab where Utah arrays and other electrodes were being inserted into the brains of monkeys to try to understand how intentions were being encoded in the brain.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So, I ended up there with the idea that maybe I would be a neurologist and study the brain on the side. And then discovered that neurology &#8230; Again, I&#8217;m going to make enemies by saying this, but neurology predominantly and distressingly to me, is the practice of diagnosing a thing and then saying, &#8220;Good luck with that. There&#8217;s not much we can do.&#8221; And neurosurgery, very differently, it&#8217;s a powerful lever on taking people that are headed in a bad direction and changing their course in the sense of brain tumors that are potentially treatable or curable with surgery. Even aneurysms in the brain, blood vessels that are going to rupture, you can save lives, really, is at the end of the day what mattered to me.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And so, I was at USC, as I mentioned, that happens to be one of the great neurosurgery programs. And so, I met these truly epic neurosurgeons, Alex Khalessi, and Mike Apuzzo, and Steve Giannotta, and Marty Weiss, these epic people that were just human beings in front of me. And so, it kind of changed my thinking from neurosurgeons are distant gods that live on another planet and occasionally come and visit us, to these are humans that have problems and are people, and there&#8217;s nothing fundamentally preventing me from being one of them. And so, at the last minute in medical school, I changed gears from going into a different specialty and switched into neurosurgery, which cost me a year. I had to do another year of research because I was so far along in the process that to switch into neurosurgery, the deadlines had already passed. So, it was a decision that cost time, but absolutely worth it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, two things, I think, that residency in neurosurgery is sort of a competition of pain, of how much pain can you eat and smile? And so, there&#8217;s work hour restrictions that are not really &#8230; They&#8217;re viewed, I think, internally among the residents as weakness. And so, most neurosurgery residents try to work as hard as they can, and that, I think necessarily means working long hours and sometimes over the work hour limits.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">We care about being compliant with whatever regulations are in front of us, but I think more important than that, people want to give their all in becoming a better neurosurgeon because the stakes are so high. And so, it&#8217;s a real fight to get residents to say, go home at the end of their shift and not stay and do more surgery.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s competitive, and it&#8217;s also, as we touched on earlier, primates like power. And I think neurosurgery has long had this aura of mystique and excellence and whatever about it. And so, it&#8217;s an invitation, I think, for people that are cloaked in that authority. A board certified neurosurgeon is basically a walking fallacious appeal to authority. Right? You have license to walk into any room and act like you&#8217;re an expert on whatever. And fighting that tendency is not something that most neurosurgeons do well. Humility isn&#8217;t the forte.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I have friends who know you and whenever they speak about you that you have the surprising quality for a neurosurgeon of humility, which I think indicates that it&#8217;s not as common as perhaps in other professions, because there is a kind of gigantic sort of heroic aspect to neurosurgery, and I think it gets to people&#8217;s head a little bit.</span>

Well, I think that allows me to play well at an Elon company because Elon, one of his strengths, I think, is to just instantly see through fallacy from authority. So, nobody walks into a room that he&#8217;s in and says, &#8220;Well, goddammit, you have to trust me. I&#8217;m the guy that built the last 10 rockets,&#8221; or something. And he says, &#8220;Well, you did it wrong and we can do it better.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I&#8217;m the guy that kept Ford alive for the last 50 years. You listen to me on how to build cars.&#8221; And he says, &#8220;No.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s a sweet spot where people disagree and forcefully speak their mind and passionately defend their position, and yet, are still able to accept information from others and change their ideas when they&#8217;re wrong. And so, I like the analogy of how you polish rocks. You put hard things in a hard container and spin it. People bash against each other, and out comes a more refined product. And so, to make a good team at Neuralink, we&#8217;ve tried to find people that are not afraid to defend their ideas passionately and occasionally strongly disagree with people that they&#8217;re working with, and have the best idea come out on top.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Taking care of a father of two or three, four young kids, someone in their 30s that didn&#8217;t have it coming, and they show up in your ER having their first seizure of their life, and lo and behold, they&#8217;ve got a huge malignant inoperable or incurable brain tumor. You can only do that, I think, a handful of times before it really starts eating away at your armor. Or, a young mother that shows up that has a giant hemorrhage in her brain that she&#8217;s not going to survive from. And they bring her four-year-old daughter in to say goodbye one last time before they turn the ventilator off. The great Henry Marsh is an English neurosurgeon who said it best, I think. He says, &#8220;Every neurosurgeon carries with them a private graveyard.&#8221; And I definitely feel that, especially with young parents, that kills me. They had a lot more to give. The loss of those people specifically has a knock-on effect that&#8217;s going to make the world worse for people for a long time. And it&#8217;s just hard to feel powerless in the face of that. And that&#8217;s where I think you have to be borderline evil to fight against a company like Neuralink or to constantly be taking pot shots at us, because what we&#8217;re doing is to try to fix that stuff. We&#8217;re trying to give people options to reduce suffering. We&#8217;re trying to take the pain out of life that broken brains brings in. And yeah, this is just our little way that we&#8217;re fighting back against entropy, I guess.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Sure. Yeah. It&#8217;s a really simple, straightforward procedure. The human part of the surgery that I do is dead simple. It&#8217;s one of the most basic neurosurgery procedures imaginable. And I think there&#8217;s evidence that some version of it has been done for thousands of years. That there are examples, I think, from ancient Egypt of healed or partially healed trepanations, and from Peru or ancient times in South America where these proto-surgeons would drill holes in people&#8217;s skulls, presumably to let out the evil spirits, but maybe to drain blood clots. And there&#8217;s evidence of bone healing around the edge, meaning the people at least survived some months after a procedure.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so, what we&#8217;re doing is that. We are making a cut in the skin on the top of the head over the area of the brain that is the most potent representation of hand intentions. And so, if you are an expert concert pianist, this part of your brain is lighting up the entire time you&#8217;re playing. We call it the hand knob.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The hand knob. So, it&#8217;s all the finger movements, all of that is just firing away.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yep. There&#8217;s a little squiggle in the cortex right there. One of the folds in the brain is kind of doubly folded right on that spot. And so, you can look at it on an MRI and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s the hand knob.&#8221; And then you do a functional test and a special kind of MRI called a functional MRI, fMRI. And this part of the brain lights up when-</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Matthew MacDougall</span>

            <span class="ts-text">MRI, fMRI, and this part of the brain lights up when people, even quadriplegic people whose brains aren&#8217;t connected to their finger movements anymore, they imagine finger movements and this part of the brain still lights up. So we can ID that part of the brain in anyone who&#8217;s preparing to enter our trial and say, okay, that part of the brain we confirm is your hand intention area. And so I&#8217;ll make a little cut in the skin, we&#8217;ll flap the skin open, just like kind of opening the hood of a car, only a lot smaller, make a perfectly round one inch diameter hole in the skull, remove that bit of skull, open the lining of the brain, the covering of the brain, it&#8217;s like a little bag of water that the brain floats in, and then show that part of the brain to our robot. And then this is where the robot shines.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">It can come in and take these tiny, much smaller than human hair, electrodes and precisely insert them into the cortex, into the surface of the brain to a very precise depth, in a very precise spot that avoids all the blood vessels that are coating the surface of the brain. And after the robot&#8217;s done with its part, then the human comes back in and puts the implant into that hole in the skull and covers it up, screwing it down to the skull and sewing the skin back together. So the whole thing is a few hours long. It&#8217;s extremely low risk compared to the average neurosurgery involving the brain that might, say, open up a deeper part of the brain or manipulate blood vessels in the brain. This opening on the surface of the brain with only cortical micro- insertions carries significantly less risk than a lot of the tumor or aneurysm surgeries that are routinely done.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So I know you&#8217;re a bit biased here, but let&#8217;s compare human and machine. So what are human surgeons able to do well and what are robot surgeons able to do well at this stage of our human civilization and development?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. Humans are general purpose machines. We&#8217;re able to adapt to unusual situations. We&#8217;re able to change the plan on the fly. I remember well a surgery that I was doing many years ago down in San Diego where the plan was to open a small hole behind the ear and go reposition a blood vessel that had come to lay on the facial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, the nerve that goes to the face. When that blood vessel lays on the nerve, it can cause just intolerable, horrific shooting pain that people describe like being zapped with a cattle prod. And so the beautiful, elegant surgery is to go move this blood vessel off the nerve. The surgery team, we went in there and started moving this blood vessel and then found that there was a giant aneurysm on that blood vessel that was not easily visible on the pre-op scans. And so the plan had to dynamically change and that the human surgeons had no problem with that, were trained for all those things.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Robots wouldn&#8217;t do so well in that situation, at least in their current incarnation, fully robotic surgery, like the electrode insertion portion of the neural link surgery, it goes according to a set plan. And so the humans can interrupt the flow and change the plan, but the robot can&#8217;t really change the plan midway through. It operates according to how it was programmed and how it was asked to run. It does its job very precisely, but not with a wide degree of latitude in how to react to changing conditions.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there could be just a very large number of ways that you could be surprised as a surgeon? When you enter a situation, there could be subtle things that you have to dynamically adjust to.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think we are at the dawn of a new era with AI of the parameters for robot responsiveness to be dramatically broadened, right? I mean, you can&#8217;t look at a self-driving car and say that it&#8217;s operating under very narrow parameters. If a chicken runs across the road, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily programmed to deal with that specifically, but a Waymo or a self-driving Tesla would have no problem reacting to that appropriately. And so surgical robots aren&#8217;t there yet, but give it time.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then there could be a lot of semi-autonomous possibilities of maybe a robotic surgeon could say this situation is perfectly familiar, or this situation is not familiar, and in the not familiar case, a human could take over, but basically be very conservative in saying, okay, this for sure has no issues, no surprises, and let the humans deal with the surprises with the edge cases and all that. That&#8217;s one possibility. So you think eventually you&#8217;ll be out of the job? Well, you being neurosurgeon, your job being a neurosurgeon. Humans, there will not be many neurosurgeons left on this earth.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s so fascinating because if I have a line of work, I would say it&#8217;s programming. And if you ask me, for the last, I don&#8217;t know, 20 years, what I would recommend for people, I would tell them, yeah, you&#8217;ll always have a job if you&#8217;re a programmer because there&#8217;s more and more computers and all this kind of stuff and it pays well. But then you realize these large language models come along and they&#8217;re really damn good at generating code. So overnight you could be surprised like, wow, what is the contribution of the human really? But then you start to think, okay, it does seem that humans have ability, like you said, to deal with novel situations. In the case of programming, it&#8217;s the ability to come up with novel ideas to solve problems. It seems like machines aren&#8217;t quite yet able to do that. And when the stakes are very high, when it&#8217;s life critical as it is in surgery, especially in neurosurgery, then the stakes are very high for a robot to actually replace a human. But it&#8217;s fascinating that in this case of Neuralink, there&#8217;s a human robot collaboration.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I saw that there&#8217;s a lot of practice going on. I mean everything in Neuralink is tested extremely rigorously, but one of the things I saw that there&#8217;s a proxy on which the surgeries are performed. So this is both for the robot and for the human, for everybody involved in the entire pipeline. What&#8217;s that like, practicing the surgery?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Matthew MacDougall</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s pretty intense. So there&#8217;s no analog to this in human surgery. Human surgery is sort of this artisanal craft that&#8217;s handed down directly from master to pupil over the generations. I mean, literally the way you learn to be a surgeon on humans is by doing surgery on humans. I mean, first you watch your professors do a bunch of surgery, and then finally they put the trivial parts of the surgery into your hands, and then the more complex parts, and as your understanding of the point and the purposes of the surgery increases, you get more responsibility in the perfect condition. Doesn&#8217;t always go well. In Neuralink&#8217;s case, the approach is a bit different. We, of course, practiced as far as we could on animals. We did hundreds of animal surgeries. And when it came time to do the first human, we had just an amazing team of engineers build incredibly lifelike models. One of the engineers, Fran Romano in particular, built a pulsating brain in a custom 3-D printed skull that matches exactly the patient&#8217;s anatomy, including their face and scalp characteristics.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And so when I was able to practice that, it&#8217;s as close as it really reasonably should get to being the real thing in all the details, including having a mannequin body attached to this custom head. And so when we were doing the practice surgeries, we&#8217;d wheel that body into the CT scanner and take a mock CT scan and wheel it back in and conduct all the normal safety checks, verbally, &#8220;Stop. This patient we&#8217;re confirming his identification is mannequin number&#8230;&#8221; Blah, blah, blah. And then opening the brain in exactly the right spot using standard operative neuro-navigation equipment, standard surgical drills in the same OR that we do all of our practice surgeries in at Neuralink and having the skull open and have the brain pulse, which adds a degree of difficulty for the robot to perfectly precisely plan and insert those electrodes to the right depth and location. And so we kind of broke new ground on how extensively we practiced for this surgery.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there was a historic moment, a big milestone for Neuralink, in part for humanity, with the first human getting a Neuralink implant in January of this year. Take me through the surgery on Noland. What did it feel like to be part of this?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Well, we are lucky to have just incredible partners at the Barrow Neurologic Institute. They are, I think, the premier neurosurgical hospital in the world. They made everything as easy as possible for the trial to get going and helped us immensely with their expertise on how to arrange the details. It was a much more high pressure surgery in some ways. I mean, even though the outcome wasn&#8217;t particularly in question in terms of our participant&#8217;s safety, the number of observers, the number of people, there&#8217;s conference rooms full of people watching live streams in the hospital rooting for this to go perfectly, and that just adds pressure that is not typical for even the most intense production neurosurgery, say, removing a tumor or placing deep brain stimulation electrodes, and it had never been done on a human before. There were unknown unknowns.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so definitely a moderate pucker factor there for the whole team not knowing if we were going to encounter, say, a degree of brain movement that was unanticipated or a degree of brain sag that took the brain far away from the skull and made it difficult to insert or some other unknown unknown problem. Fortunately everything went well and that surgery is one of the smoothest outcomes we could have imagined.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It just sucks because I think it puts pressure on people. It discourages people from trying to solve really hard problems because to solve hard problems, you have to go into the unknown. You have to do things that haven&#8217;t been done before and you have to take risks, calculated risks, you have to do all kinds of safety precautions, but risks nevertheless. I just wish there would be more celebration of that, of the risk taking versus people just waiting on the sidelines waiting for failure and then pointing out the failure. Yeah, it sucks. But in this case, it&#8217;s really great that everything went just flawlessly, but it&#8217;s unnecessary pressure, I would say.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Right. The software engineers are amazing on this team, and so they actually provided an interface where you can essentially use a lasso tool and select a prime area of brain real estate, and it will automatically avoid the blood vessels in that region and automatically place a bunch of targets. That allows the human robot operator to select really good areas of brain and make dense applications of targets in those regions, the regions we think are going to have the most high fidelity representations of finger movements and arm movement intentions.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So talking broadly about neurosurgery, we can get anywhere. It&#8217;s routine for me to put deep brain stimulating electrodes near the very bottom of the brain, entering from the top and passing about a two millimeter wire all the way into the bottom of the brain. And that&#8217;s not revolutionary, a lot of people do that, and we can do that with very high precision. I use a robot from Globus to do that surgery several times a month. It&#8217;s pretty routine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so it&#8217;s a cool process on the software side. You take a preoperative MRI that&#8217;s extremely high resolution, data of the entire brain, you put the patient to sleep, put their head in a frame that holds the skull very rigidly, and then you take a CT scan of their head while they&#8217;re asleep with that frame on and then merge the MRI and the CT in software. You have a plan based on the MRI where you can see these nuclei deep in the brain. You can&#8217;t see them on CT, but if you trust the merging of the two images, then you indirectly know on the CT where that is, and therefore indirectly know where in reference to the titanium frame screwed to their head those targets are. And so this is sixties technology to manually compute trajectories given the entry point and target and dial in some goofy looking titanium manual actuators with little tick marks on them.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">The modern version of that is to use a robot. Just like a little Kuka arm you might see building cars at the Tesla factory, this small robot arm can show you the trajectory that you intended from the pre-op MRI and establish a very rigid holder through which you can drill a small hole in the skull and pass a small rigid wire deep into that area of the brain that&#8217;s hollow, and put your electrode through that hollow wire and then remove all of that except the electrode. So you end up with the electrode very, very precisely placed far from the skull surface. Now, that&#8217;s standard technology that&#8217;s already been out in the world for a while. Neuralink right now is focused entirely on cortical targets, surface targets because there&#8217;s no trivial way to get, say, hundreds of wires deep inside the brain without doing a lot of damage. So your question, what do you see? Well, I see an MRI on a screen. I can&#8217;t see everything that DBS electrode is passing through on its way to that deep target.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so it&#8217;s accepted with this approach that there&#8217;s going to be about one in a hundred patients who have a bleed somewhere in the brain as a result of passing that wire blindly into the deep part of the brain. That&#8217;s not an acceptable safety profile for Neuralink. We start from the position that we want this to be dramatically maybe two or three orders of magnitude safer than that, safe enough, really, that you or I, without a profound medical problem, might on our lunch break someday say, &#8220;Yeah, sure, I&#8217;ll get that. I&#8217;d been meaning to upgrade to the latest version.&#8221; And so the safety constraints given that are high, and so we haven&#8217;t settled on a final solution for arbitrarily approaching deep targets in the brain.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Exactly. So we&#8217;ve got vision on the surface. We actually have made a huge amount of progress sewing electrodes into the spinal cord as a potential workaround for a spinal cord injury that would allow a brain mounted implant to translate motor intentions to a spine mounted implant that can affect muscle contractions in previously paralyzed arms and legs.</span>

Repetitions, humility, recognizing that you aren&#8217;t perfect at any stage along the way, recognizing you&#8217;ve got improvements to make in your technique, being open to feedback and coaching from people with a different perspective on how to do it, and then just the constant will to do better. That, fortunately, if you&#8217;re not a sociopath, I think your patients bring that with them to the office visits every day. They force you to want to do better all the time.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. A fair bit. A good example for us is the angle of the skull relative to the normal plane of the body axis of the skull over hand knob is pretty wide variation. Some people have really flat skulls and some people have really steeply angled skulls over that area, and that has consequences for how their head can be fixed in sort of the frame that we use and how the robot has to approach the skull. Yeah, people&#8217;s bodies are built as differently as the people you see walking down the street, as much variability and body shape and size as you see there. We see in brain anatomy and skull anatomy, there are some people who we&#8217;ve had to exclude from our trial for having skulls that are too thick or too thin or scalp that&#8217;s too thick or too thin. I think we have the middle 97% or so of people, but you can&#8217;t account for all human anatomy variability.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Not too bad. Once you really get used to this, that&#8217;s where experience and skill and education really come into play is if you stare at a thousand brains, it becomes easier to kind of mentally peel back the, say, for instance, blood vessels that are obscuring the sulci and gyri, know kind of the wrinkle pattern of the surface of the brain. Occasionally when you&#8217;re first starting to do this and you open the skull, it doesn&#8217;t match what you thought you were going to see based on the MRI.

That guy sort of lays with his legs up at the top of the brain and face arm areas farther down, and then some kind of mouth, lip, tongue areas farther down. And so the hand is right in there, and then the areas that control speech, at least on the left side of the brain in most people are just below that. And so any muscle that you voluntarily move in your body, the vast majority of that references that strip or those intentions come from that strip of brain, and the wrinkle for hand knob is right in the middle of that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Vision&#8217;s a little deeper. And so this gets to your question about how deep can you get. To do vision, we can&#8217;t just do the surface of the brain. We have to be able to go in, not as deep as we&#8217;d have to go for DBS, but maybe a centimeter deeper than we&#8217;re used to for hand insertions. And so that&#8217;s work in progress.

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s rigid and then if you look at the threads, they&#8217;re flexible. What can you say that&#8217;s interesting to you about that kind of approach of the flexible threads to deliver the electrodes next to the neurons?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I mean, the goal there comes from experience. I mean, we stand on the shoulders of people that made Utah Arrays and used Utah Arrays for decades before we ever even came along. Neuralink arose, partly this approach to technology arose out of a need recognized after Utah Arrays would fail routinely because the rigid electrodes, those spikes that are literally hammered using an air hammer into the brain, those spikes generate a bad immune response that encapsulates the electrode spikes in scar tissue essentially. And so one of the projects that was being worked on in the Anderson Lab at Caltech when I got there was to see if you could use chemotherapy to prevent the formation of scars. Things are pretty bad when you&#8217;re jamming a bed of nails into the brain, and then treating that with chemotherapy to try to prevent scar tissue, it&#8217;s like, maybe we&#8217;ve gotten off track here, guys. Maybe there&#8217;s a fundamental redesign necessary.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so Neuralink&#8217;s approach of using highly flexible, tiny electrodes avoids a lot of the bleeding, avoids a lot of the immune response that ends up happening when rigid electrodes are pounded into the brain. And so what we see is our electrode longevity and functionality and the health of the brain tissue immediately surrounding the electrode is excellent. I mean, it goes on for years now in our animal models.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think the most interesting maybe underappreciated fact is that it really does control almost everything. I don&#8217;t know, for an out of the blue example, imagine you want a lever on fertility. You want to be able to turn fertility on and off. There are legitimate targets in the brain itself to modulate fertility, say blood pressure. You want to modulate blood pressure, there are legitimate targets in the brain for doing that. Things that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious as brain problems are potentially solvable in the brain. And so I think it&#8217;s an under-explored area for primary treatments of all the things that bother people.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s a really fascinating way to look at it. There&#8217;s a lot of conditions we might think have nothing to do with the brain, but they might just be symptoms of something that actually started in the brain.

            <span class="ts-text">The use case of the mouse is after researching all this and part of it&#8217;s just watching Nolan have so much fun. If you can get that bits per second look really high with the mouse, being able to interact, because if you think about the way on the smartphone, the way you swipe, that was transformational. How we interact with the thing, it&#8217;s subtle, you don&#8217;t realize it, but to be able to touch a phone and to scroll with your finger, that changed everything. People were sure you need a keyboard to type. There&#8217;s a lot of HCI aspects to that that changed how we interact with computers, so there could be a certain rate of speed with the mouse that would change everything. You might be able to just click around a screen extremely fast. I can&#8217;t see myself getting a Neuralink for much more rapid interaction with the digital devices.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I think recording speech intentions from the brain might change things as well, the value proposition for the average person. A keyboard is a pretty clunky human interface, requires a lot of training. It&#8217;s highly variable in the maximum performance that the average person can achieve. I think taking that out of the equation and just having a natural word to computer interface might change things for a lot of people.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;d be hilarious if that is the reason people do it. Even if you have speech to text, that&#8217;s extremely accurate. It currently isn&#8217;t, but it&#8217;d say you&#8217;ve gotten super accurate. It&#8217;d be hilarious if people went for Neuralink. Just so you avoid the embarrassing aspect of speaking, looking like a douchebag speaking to your phone in public, which is a real, that&#8217;s a real constraint.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I mean with a bone conducting case, that can be an invisible headphone, say, and the ability to think words into software and have it respond to you. That starts to sound sort of like embedded super intelligence. If you can silently ask for the Wikipedia article on any subject and have it read to you without any observable change happening in the outside world. For one thing, standardized testing is obsolete.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">If it&#8217;s done well in the UX side, it could change, I don&#8217;t know if it transforms society, but it really can create a kind of shift in the way we interact with digital devices in the way that a smartphone did. Just having to look into the safety of everything involved, I would totally try it. So it doesn&#8217;t have to go to some incredible thing where you have, it connects your vision or to some other, it connects all over your brain. That could be just connecting to the hand knob. You might have a lot of interesting interaction, human computer interaction possibilities. That&#8217;s really interesting.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So from all the surgeries you&#8217;ve done, from everything you understand the brain, how much does neuroplasticity come into play? How adaptable is the brain? For example, just even in the case of healing from surgery or adapting to the post-surgery situation.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">The answer that is sad for me and other people of my demographic is that plasticity decreases with age. Healing decreases with age. I have too much gray hair to be optimistic about that. There are theoretical ways to increase plasticity using electrical stimulation. Nothing that is totally proven out as a robust enough mechanism to offer widely to people.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But yeah, I think there&#8217;s cause for optimism that we might find something useful in terms of say, an implanted electrode that improves learning. Certainly there&#8217;s been some really amazing work recently from Nicholas Schiff, Jonathan Baker and others who have a cohort of patients with moderate traumatic brain injury who have had electrodes placed in the deep nucleus in the brain called the central median nucleus or just near central median nucleus, and when they apply small amounts of electricity to that part of the brain, it&#8217;s almost like electronic caffeine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">They&#8217;re able to improve people&#8217;s attention and focus. They&#8217;re able to improve how well people can perform a task. I think in one case, someone who was unable to work, after the device was turned on, they were able to get a job. And that&#8217;s sort of one of the holy grails for me with Neuralink and other technologies like this is from a purely utilitarian standpoint, can we make people able to take care of themselves and their families economically again? Can we make it so someone who&#8217;s fully dependent and even maybe requires a lot of caregiver resources, can we put them in a position to be fully independent, taking care of themselves, giving back to their communities? I think that&#8217;s a very compelling proposition and what motivates a lot of what I do and what a lot of the people at Neuralink are working for.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s just a cool possibility that if you put a Neuralink in there, that the brain adapts the other part of the brain adapts too and integrates it. The capacity of the brain to do that is really interesting. Probably unknown to the degree to which you can do that, but you&#8217;re now connecting an external thing to it, especially once it&#8217;s doing stimulation. The biological brain and the electronic brain outside of it working together, the possibilities there are really interesting. It&#8217;s still unknown, but interesting. It feels like the brain is really good at adapting to whatever, but of course it is a system that by itself is already, everything serves a purpose and so you don&#8217;t want to mess with it too much.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it&#8217;s like eliminating a species from an ecology. You don&#8217;t know what the delicate interconnections and dependencies are. The brain is certainly a delicate, complex beast, and we don&#8217;t know every potential downstream consequence of a single change that we make.</span>

We want to get away from requiring intense expertise or intense experience to have this done and make it as simple and translatable as possible. I mean, I would love it if every neurosurgeon on the planet had no problem doing this. I think we&#8217;re probably far from a regulatory environment that would allow people that aren&#8217;t neurosurgeons to do this, but not impossible.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it gives you a very visceral sense, and this may sound trite, but it gives you a very visceral sense that death is inevitable. On one hand, as a neurosurgeon, you&#8217;re deeply involved in these, just hard to fathom tragedies, young parents dying, leaving a four-year-old behind, say. And on the other hand, it takes the sting out of it a bit because you see how just mind-numbingly universal death is. There&#8217;s zero chance that I&#8217;m going to avoid it. I know techno-optimists right now and longevity buffs right now would disagree on that 0.000% estimate, but I don&#8217;t see any chance that our generation is going to avoid it. Entropy is a powerful force and we are very ornate, delicate, brittle, DNA machines that aren&#8217;t up to the cosmic ray bombardment that we&#8217;re subjected to.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So on the one hand, every human that has ever lived died or will die. On the other hand, it&#8217;s just one of the hardest things to imagine inflicting on anyone that you love is having them gone. I mean, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had friends that aren&#8217;t living anymore and it&#8217;s hard to even think about them. And so I wish I had arrived at the point of nirvana where death doesn&#8217;t have a sting, I&#8217;m not worried about it. But I can at least say that I&#8217;m comfortable with the certainty of it, if not having found out how to take the tragedy out of it. When I think about my kids either not having me or me not having them or my wife.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Maybe I&#8217;ve come to accept the intellectual certainty of it, but it may be the pain that comes with losing the people you love. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve come to understand the existential aspect of it, that this is going to end, and I don&#8217;t mean in some trite way. I mean, it certainly feels like it&#8217;s not going to end. You live life like it&#8217;s not going to end. And the fact that this light that&#8217;s shining, this consciousness is going to no longer be in one moment, maybe today. It fills me when I really am able to load all that in with Ernest Becker&#8217;s terror. It is a real fear.</span>

It&#8217;s not such a simple thing, &#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s the way life is.&#8221; If you really can load that in, it&#8217;s hard, but I think that&#8217;s why the Stoics did it, because it helps you get your shit together and be like, &#8220;The moment, every single moment you&#8217;re alive is just beautiful&#8221; and it&#8217;s terrifying that it&#8217;s going to end, and it&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re shivering in the cold, a child helpless.

            <span class="ts-text">And then it makes you, when you have warmth, when you have the safety, when you have the love to really appreciate it.

So it is good to know that you&#8217;re kind of still struggling with that. There&#8217;s the neurosurgeon and then there&#8217;s a human, and the human is still able to struggle with that and feel the fear of that and the pain of that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it definitely makes you ask the question of how many of these can you see and not say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this anymore&#8221;? But I mean you said it well, I think it gives you an opportunity to just appreciate that you&#8217;re alive today and I&#8217;ve got three kids and an amazing wife, and I am really happy. Things are good. I get to help on a project that I think matters. I think it moves us forward. I&#8217;m a very lucky person.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s the early steps of a potentially gigantic leap for humanity. It&#8217;s a really interesting one. And it&#8217;s cool because you read about all this stuff in history where it&#8217;s like the early days. I&#8217;ve been reading, before going to the Amazon, I would read about explorers that would go and explore even the Amazon jungle for the first time. It&#8217;s just those are the early steps or early steps into space, early steps in any discipline in physics and mathematics, and it&#8217;s cool because on the grand scale, these are the early steps into delving deep into the human brain, so not just observing the brain but be able to interact with the human brain. It&#8217;s going to help a lot of people, but it also might help us understand what the hell&#8217;s going on in there.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I think ultimately we want to give people more levers that they can pull. You want to give people options. If you can give someone a dial that they can turn on how happy they are, I think that makes people really uncomfortable. But now talk about major depressive disorder. Talk about people that are committing suicide at an alarming rate in this country, and try to justify that queasiness in that light of, you can give people a knob to take away suicidal ideation, suicidal intention. I would give them that knob. I don&#8217;t know how you justify not doing that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You can think about all the suffering that&#8217;s going on in the world, every single human being that&#8217;s suffering right now. It&#8217;ll be a glowing red dot. The more suffering, the more it&#8217;s glowing, and you just see the map of human suffering and any technology that allows you to dim that light of suffering on a grand scale is pretty exciting. Because there&#8217;s a lot of people suffering and most of them suffer quietly, and we look away too often, and we should remember those are suffering because once again, most of them are suffering quietly.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, and on a grander scale, the fabric of society. People have a lot of complaints about how our social fabric is working or not working, how our politics is working or not working. Those things are made of neurochemistry too in aggregate, right? Our politics is composed of individuals with human brains, and the way it works or doesn&#8217;t work is potentially tunable in the sense that, I don&#8217;t know, say remove our addictive behaviors or tune our addictive behaviors for social media or our addiction to outrage, our addiction to sharing the most angry political tweet we can find. I don&#8217;t think that leads to a functional society, and if you had options for people to moderate that maladaptive behavior, there could be huge benefits to society. Maybe we could all work together a little more harmoniously toward useful ends.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. When you, all the surgeries you&#8217;ve done, have you seen consciousness in there ever? Was there a glowing light?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I have this sense that I never found it, never removed it like a Dementor in Harry Potter. I have this sense that consciousness is a lot less magical than our instincts want to claim it is. It seems to me like a useful analog for about what consciousness is in the brain is that we have a really good intuitive understanding of what it means to say, touch your skin and know what&#8217;s being touched. And I think consciousness is just that level of sensory mapping applied to the thought processes in the brain itself.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So what I&#8217;m saying is, consciousness is the sensation of some part of your brain being active, so you feel it working. You feel the part of your brain that thinks of red things or winged creatures or the taste of coffee. You feel those parts of your brain being active, the way that I&#8217;m feeling my palm being touched, and that sensory system that feels the brain working is consciousness.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s so brilliant. It&#8217;s the same way. It&#8217;s the sensation of touch when you&#8217;re touching a thing. Consciousness is the sensation of you feeling your brain working, your brain thinking, your brain perceiving.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Which isn&#8217;t like a warping of space-time or some quantum field effect, right? It&#8217;s nothing magical. People always want to ascribe to consciousness something truly different, and there&#8217;s this awesome long history of people looking at whatever the latest discovery in physics is to explain consciousness because it&#8217;s the most magical, the most out there thing that you can think of, and people always want to do that with consciousness. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessary. It&#8217;s just a very useful and gratifying way of feeling your brain work.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matthew MacDougall. Now, dear friends, here&#8217;s Bliss Chapman, brain interface software lead at Neuralink. You told me that you&#8217;ve met hundreds of people with spinal cord injuries or with ALS, and that your motivation for helping at Neuralink is grounded in wanting to help them. Can you describe this motivation?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. First, just a thank you to all the people I&#8217;ve gotten a chance to speak with for sharing their stories with me. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any world really in which I can share their stories as powerful way as they can, but just I think to summarize at a very high level, what I hear over and over again is that people with ALS or severe spinal cord injury in a place where they basically can&#8217;t move physically anymore, really at the end of the day are looking for independence. And that can mean different things for different people.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=18422">(05:07:02)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">For some folks, it can mean the ability just to be able to communicate again independently without needing to wear something on their face, without needing a caretaker to be able to put something in their mouth. For some folks, it can mean independence to be able to work again, to be able to navigate a computer digitally, efficiently enough to be able to get a job, to be able to support themselves, to be able to move out and ultimately be able to support themselves after their family maybe isn&#8217;t there anymore to take care of them.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And for some folks, it&#8217;s as simple as just being able to respond to their kid in time before they run away or get interested in something else. And these are deeply personal and very human problems. And what strikes me again and again when talking with these folks is that this is actually an engineering problem. This is a problem that with the right resources, with the right team, can make a lot of progress on. And at the end of the day, I think that&#8217;s a deeply inspiring message and something that makes me excited to get up every day.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">So it&#8217;s both an engineering problem in terms of a BCI, for example, that can give them capabilities where they can interact with the world, but also on the other side, it&#8217;s an engineering problem for the rest of the world to make it more accessible for people living with quadriplegia?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. And actually, I&#8217;ll take a broad view lens on this for a second. I think I&#8217;m very in favor of anyone working in this problem space. So beyond BCI, I&#8217;m happy and excited and willing to support any way I can, folks working on eye tracking systems, working on speech to text systems, working on head trackers or mouse sticks or quad sticks. And I&#8217;ve met many engineers and folks in the community that do exactly those things.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I think for the people we&#8217;re trying to help, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the complexity of the solution is as long as the problem is solved. And I want to emphasize that there can be many solutions out there that can help with these problems. And BCI is one of a collection of such solutions. So BCI in particular, I think offers several advantages here. And I think the folks that recognize this immediately are usually the people who have spinal cord injury or some form of paralysis.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=18543">(05:09:03)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">Usually you don&#8217;t have to explain to them why this might be something that could be helpful. It&#8217;s usually pretty self-evident, but for the rest of us folks that don&#8217;t live with severe spinal cord injury or who don&#8217;t know somebody with ALS, it&#8217;s not often obvious why you would want a brain implant to be able to connect and navigate a computer.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And it&#8217;s surprisingly nuanced, and to the degree that I&#8217;ve learned a huge amount just working with Noland in the first Neuralink clinical trial and understanding from him and his words why this device is impactful for him, and it&#8217;s a nuanced topic. It can be the case that even if you can achieve the same thing, for example, with a mouse stick when navigating a computer, he doesn&#8217;t have access to that mouse stick every single minute of the day. He only has access when someone is available to put it in front of him. And so a BCI can really offer a level of independence and autonomy that, if it wasn&#8217;t literally physically part of your body, it&#8217;d be hard to achieve in any other way.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s a lot of fascinating aspects to what it takes to get Noland to be able to control a cursor on the screen with his mind. You texted me something that I just love. You said, &#8220;I was part of the team that interviewed and selected P1, I was in the operating room during the first human surgery monitoring live signals coming out of the brain. I work with the user basically every day to develop new UX paradigms, decoding strategies, and I was part of the team that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded.&#8221; We&#8217;ll talk about, I think every aspect of that, but just zooming out, what was it like to be a part of that team and part of that historic, I would say, historic first?</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I think for me, this is something I&#8217;ve been excited about for close to 10 years now. And so to be able to be even just some small part of making it a reality is extremely exciting. A couple maybe special moments during that whole process that I&#8217;ll never really truly forget. One of them is entering the actual surgery. At that point in time, I know Noland quite well. I know his family. And so I think the initial reaction when Noland is rolled into the operating room is just an &#8220;Oh, shit&#8221; kind of reaction. But at that point, muscle memory kicks in and you sort of go into, you let your body just do all the talking.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">And I have the lucky job in that particular procedure to just be in charge of monitoring the implant. So my job is to sit there, to look at the signals coming off the implant, to look at the live brain data streaming off the device as threads are being inserted into the brain and just to basically observe and make sure that nothing is going wrong or that there&#8217;s no red flags or fault conditions that we need to go and investigate or pause the surgery to debug.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And because I had that sort of spectator view of the surgery, I had a slightly removed perspective than I think most folks in the room. I got to sit there and think to myself, &#8220;Wow, that brain is moving a lot.&#8221; When you look inside the craniectomy that we stick the threads in, one thing that most people don&#8217;t realize is the brain moves. The brain moves a lot when you breathe, your heart beats, and you can see it visibly. So that&#8217;s something that I think was a surprise to me and very, very exciting to be able to see someone&#8217;s brain who you physically know and have talked with that length, actually pausing and moving inside their skull.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Actually, I didn&#8217;t realize that in terms of the thread sending, so the Neuralink implant is active during surgery and one thread at a time, you&#8217;re able to start seeing the signal?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So actually in the operating room, right after we sort of finished all the thread insertions, I started collecting what&#8217;s called broadband data. So broadband is basically the most raw form of signal you can collect from a Neuralink electrode. It&#8217;s essentially a measurement of the local fuel potential or the voltage essentially measured by that electrode. And we have a certain mode in our application that allows us to visualize where detected spikes are. So it visualizes where in the broadband signal and it&#8217;s very, very raw form of the data, a neuron is actually spiking. And so one of these moments that I&#8217;ll never forget as part of this whole clinical trial is seeing live in the operating room while he&#8217;s still under anesthesia, beautiful spikes being shown in the application, just streaming live to a device I&#8217;m holding in my hand.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">During that procedure, there was actually a lot of cameramen in the room, so they also were curious and wanted to see, there&#8217;s several neurosurgeons in the room who were all just excited to see robots taking their job, and they were all crowded around a small little iPhone watching this live brain data stream out of his brain.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So what about when Noland woke up? Do you remember a moment where he was able to move the cursor, not move the cursor, but get signal from the brain such that it was able to show that there&#8217;s a connection?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah. So we are quite excited to move as quickly as we can, and Noland was really, really excited to get started. He wanted to get started, actually the day of surgery, but we waited until the next morning very patiently. It&#8217;s a long night.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; we waited until the next morning very patiently. So a long night. And the next morning in the ICU where he was recovering, he wanted to get started and actually start to understand what kind of signal we can measure from his brain. And maybe for folks who are not familiar with the Neuralink system, we implant the Neuralink system or the Neuralink implant in the motor cortex. So the motor cortex is responsible for representing things like motor intent. If you imagine closing and opening your hand, that kind of signal representation would be present in the motor cortex.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=18931">(05:15:31)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">If you imagine moving your arm back and forth or wiggling a pinky, this sort of signal can be present in the motor cortex. So one of the ways we start to map out what kind of signal do we actually have access to, in any particular individual&#8217;s brain, is through this task called body mapping. And body mapping is where you essentially present a visual to the user and you say, &#8220;Hey, imagine doing this,&#8221; and their visual is a 3D hand opening, closing or index finger modulating up and down.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=18955">(05:15:55)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And you ask the user to imagine that, and obviously you can&#8217;t see them do this, because they&#8217;re paralyzed, so you can&#8217;t see them actually move their arm. But while they do this task, you can record neural activity and you can basically offline model and check, &#8220;Can I predict, or can I detect the modulation corresponding with those different actions?&#8221; And so we did that task and we realized, &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s actually some modulation associated with some of his hand motion,&#8221; which was a first indication that, &#8220;okay, we can potentially use that modulation to do useful things in the world.&#8221; For example, control a computer cursor.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And he started playing with it, the first time we showed him it. And we actually just took the same live view of his brain activity and put it in front of him and we said, &#8220;Hey, you tell us what&#8217;s going on? We&#8217;re not you. You&#8217;re able to imagine different things, and we know that it&#8217;s modulating some of these neurons, so you figure out for us, what that is actually representing.&#8221; And so he played with it for a bit. He was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite get it yet.&#8221; He played for a bit longer and he said, &#8220;Oh, when I move this finger, I see this particular neuron start to fire more.&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And I said, &#8220;Okay, prove it. Do it again.&#8221; And so he said, &#8220;Okay, three, two, one,&#8221; boom. And the minute he moved, you can see instantaneously this neuron is firing, single neuron. I can tell you the exact channel number if you&#8217;re interested. It&#8217;s stuck in my brain now forever. But that single channel firing was a beautiful indication that it was behaved really modulated, neural activity, that could then be used for downstreaming tasks, like decoding a computer cursor.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And when you say single channel, is that associated with a single electrode?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s incredible that, that works. When I was learning about all this and loading it in, it was just blowing my mind that the intention, you can visualize yourself moving the finger. That can turn into a signal, and the fact that you can then skip that step and visualize the cursor moving, or have the intention of the cursor moving. And that leading to a signal that can then be used to move the cursor? There is so many exciting things there to learn about the brain, about the way the brain works, the very fact of there existing signal that can be used, is really powerful.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But it feels like that&#8217;s just the beginning of figuring out how that signal could be used really, really effectively? I should also just, there&#8217;s so many fascinating details here, but you mentioned the body mapping step. At least in the version I saw, that Noland was showing off, there&#8217;s a super nice interface, a graphical interface, but it just felt like I was in the future.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I guess it visualizes you moving the hand, and there&#8217;s a very sexy polished interface that, &#8220;Hello,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a voice component, but it just felt like when you wake up in a really nice video game, and this is the tutorial at the beginning of that video game.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. And I think the UX design component here is underrated for BCI development in general. There&#8217;s a whole interaction effect between the ways in which you visualize an instruction to the user, and the kinds of signal you can get back. And that quality of your behavioral alignment to the neural signal, is a function of how good you are at expressing to the user what you want them to do. And so yeah, we spend a lot of time thinking about the UX, of how we build our applications, of how the decoder actually functions, the control surfaces it provides to the user. All these little details matter a lot.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s a N1 implant that has, like we mentioned, 1,024 electrodes, and that&#8217;s collecting raw data, raw signal. What does that signal look like? And what are the different steps along the way before it&#8217;s transmitted, and what is transmitted? All that kind of stuff.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So maybe before diving into what we do, it&#8217;s worth understanding what we&#8217;re trying to measure, because that dictates a lot of the requirements for the system that we build. And what we&#8217;re trying to measure is really individual neurons, producing action potentials. And action potential is, you can think of it like a little electrical impulse that you can detect, if you&#8217;re close enough. And by being close enough, I mean within let&#8217;s say 100 microns of that cell. And 100 microns is a very, very tiny distance. And so the number of neurons that you&#8217;re going to pick up with any given electrode, is just a small radius around that electrode.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=19233">(05:20:33)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And the other thing worth understanding about the underlying biology here, is that when neurons produce an action potential, the width of that action potential is about one millisecond. So from the start of the spike, to the end of the spike, that whole width of that characteristic feature, of a neuron firing, is one millisecond wide. And if you want to detect that an individual spike is occurring or not, you need to sample that signal, or sample the local fuel potential nearby that a neuron&#8230; Much more frequently than once a millisecond. You need to sample many, many times per millisecond, to be able to detect that this is actually the characteristic waveform of a neuron producing an action potential.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so we sample across all 1,024 electrodes, about 20,000 times a second. 20,000 times a second means for any given one millisecond window, we have about 20 samples that tell us what that exact shape of that actual potential looks like. And once we&#8217;ve sort of sampled at super high rate the underlying electrical field nearby these cells, we can process that signal into just where do we detect a spike, or where do we not? Sort of a binary signal, one or zero. Do we detect a spike in this one millisecond or not?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And we do that because the actual information carrying subspace of neural activity, is just when our spikes occurring. Essentially everything that we care about for decoding can be captured or represented in the frequency characteristics of spike trains. Meaning, how often are spikes firing in any given window of time. And so that allows us to do sort of a crazy amount of compression, from this very rich high-density signal, to something that&#8217;s much, much more sparse and compressible, that can be sent out over a wireless radio. Like a Bluetooth communication for example.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Quick tangents here. You mentioned electrode neuron, there&#8217;s a local neighborhood of neurons nearby. How difficult is it to isolate from where the spike came from?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s a whole field of academic neuroscience work on exactly this problem, of basically given a single electrode, or given a set of electrodes measuring a set of neurons. How can you sort, spike sort, which spikes are coming from what neuron? And this is a problem that&#8217;s pursued in academic work, because you care about it for understanding what&#8217;s going on in the underlying neuroscience of the brain. If you care about understanding how the brain&#8217;s representing information, how that&#8217;s evolving through time, then that&#8217;s a very, very important question to understand.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=19382">(05:23:02)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">For the engineering side of things, at least at the current scale, if the number of neurons per electrode is relatively small, you can get away with basically ignoring that problem completely. You can think of it like a random projection of neurons to electrodes, and there may be in some cases more than one neuron per electrode. But if that number is small enough, those signals can be thought of as sort of a union of the two.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And for many applications, that&#8217;s a totally reasonable trade-off to make, and can simplify the problem a lot. And as you sort of scale out channel count, the relevance of distinguishing individual neurons becomes less important. Because you have more overall signal, and you can start to rely on correlations or covariate structure in the data to help understand when that channel is firing&#8230; What does that actually represent? Because you know that when that channel&#8217;s firing in concert with these other 50 channels, that means move left. But when that same channel&#8217;s firing with concert with these other 10 channels, that means move right.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Okay. So you have to do this kind of spike detection onboard, and you have to do that super efficiently? So fast, and not use too much power, because you don&#8217;t want to be generating too much heat, so it&#8217;d have to be a super simple signal processing step?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Is there some wisdom you can share about what it takes to overcome that challenge?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So we&#8217;ve tried many different versions of basically turning this raw signal into a feature that you might want to send off the device. And I&#8217;ll say that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re at the final step of this process, this is a long journey. We have something that works clearly today, but there can be many approaches that we find in the future that are much better than what we do right now. So some versions of what we do right now, and there&#8217;s a lot of academic heritage to these ideas, so I don&#8217;t want to claim that these are original Neuralink ideas or anything like that.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">But one of these ideas is basically to build sort of like a convolutional filter almost, if you will. That slides across the signal and looks for a certain template to be matched. That template consists of how deep the spike modulates, how much it recovers, and what the duration and window of time is for that, the whole process takes. And if you can see in the signal that, that template is matched within certain bounds, then you can say, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s a spike.&#8221; One reason that approach is super convenient, is that you can actually implement that extremely efficiently in hardware. Which means that you can run it in low power across 1,024 channels all at once.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">Another approach that we&#8217;ve recently started exploring, and this can be combined with the spike detection approach, is something called spike band power. And the benefits of that approach are that you may be able to pick up some signal from neurons that are maybe too far away to be detected as a spike, because the farther away you are from an electrode, the weaker that actual spike waveform will look like on that electrode. So you might be able to pick up population level activity of things that are maybe slightly outside the normal recording radius&#8230; What neuroscientists sometimes refer to as the hash of activity, the other stuff that&#8217;s going on. And you can look at across many channels how that background noise is behaving, and you might be able to get more juice out of the signal that way.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">But it comes at a cost. That signal is now a floating point representation, which means it&#8217;s more expensive to send out over a power. It means you have to find different ways to compress it, that are different than what you can apply to binary signals. So there&#8217;s a lot of different challenges associated with these different modalities.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So also in terms of communication, you&#8217;re limited by the amount of data you can send?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And also because you&#8217;re currently using the Bluetooth protocol, you have to batch stuff together? But you have to also do this, keeping the latency crazy low? Crazy low? Anything to say about the latency?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Which, it is another way to interact with a digital device, and there&#8217;s something to that, if it&#8217;s a fundamentally different experience, more efficient experience? Even if it&#8217;s not like some kind of full-on high bandwidth communication, if it&#8217;s just the ability to move the mouse 10X faster, like the bits per second? If I can achieve a bits per second at 10X what I can do with a mouse, that&#8217;s a really interesting possibility of what that can do? Especially as you get really good at it. With training.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s definitely the case that you have a higher ceiling performance, because you don&#8217;t have to buffer your intention through your arm, through your muscle. You get just by nature of having a brain implant at all, like 75 millisecond lead time on any action that you&#8217;re actually trying to take. And there&#8217;s some nuance to this, there&#8217;s evidence that the motor cortex, you can sort of plan out sequences of actions, so you may not get that whole benefit all the time. But for reaction time style games, where you just want to&#8230; Somebody&#8217;s over here, snipe them, that kind of thing? You actually do have just an inherent advantage, because you don&#8217;t need to go through muscle.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the question is, just how much faster can you make it? And we&#8217;re already faster than what you would do if you&#8217;re going through muscle from a latency point of view, and we&#8217;re in the early stages of that. I think we can push it. So our end to end latency right now from brain spike to cursor movement, it&#8217;s about 22 milliseconds. If you think about the best mice in the world, the best gaming mice, that&#8217;s about five milliseconds ish of latency, depending on how you measure, depending how fast your screen refreshes, there&#8217;s a lot of characteristics that matter there. And the rough time for a neuron in the brain to actually impact your command of your hand is about 75 milliseconds.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So if you look at those numbers, you can see that we&#8217;re already competitive and slightly faster than what you&#8217;d get by actually moving your hand. And this is something that if you ask Noland about it, when he moved the cursor for the first time&#8230; We asked him about this, it was something I was super curious about. &#8220;What does it feel like when you&#8217;re modulating a click intention, or when you&#8217;re trying to just move the cursor to the right?&#8221; He said it moves before he is actually intending it to. Which is kind of a surreal thing, and something that I would love to experience myself one day, what is that like to have the thing just be so immediate, so fluid, that it feels like it&#8217;s happening before you&#8217;re actually intending it to move?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I suppose we&#8217;ve gotten used to that latency, that natural latency that happens. So is currently the bottleneck, the communication? So the Bluetooth communication? What&#8217;s the actual bottleneck? I mean there&#8217;s always going to be a bottleneck, what&#8217;s the current bottleneck?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. A couple things. So kind of hilariously, Bluetooth low- energy protocol has some restrictions on how fast you can communicate. So the protocol itself establishes a standard of the most frequent sort of updates you can send, are on the order of 7.5 milliseconds. And as we push latency down to the level of individual spikes impacting control, that level of resolution, that kind of protocol is going to become a limiting factor at some scale.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Another sort of important nuance to this, is that it&#8217;s not just the Neuralink itself that&#8217;s part of this equation. If you start pushing latency below the level of how fast you&#8217;re going to refresh, then you have another problem.

Now we figured out what the spikes are, we&#8217;ve got them all together, now we&#8217;re sending that over to the app. What&#8217;s the decoding step look like?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Actually, even if we zoom out beyond that, what is the app? So there&#8217;s an implant that&#8217;s wirelessly communicating with any digital device that has an app installed.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So maybe can you tell me at high-level what the app is, what the software is outside of the brain?</span>

            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So maybe working backwards from the goal. The goal is to help someone with paralysis. In this case, Noland. Be able to navigate his computer independently. And we think the best way to do that, is to offer them the same tools that we have to navigate our software. Because we don&#8217;t want to have to rebuild an entire software ecosystem for the brain, at least not yet. Maybe someday you can imagine there&#8217;s UXs that are built natively for BCI, but in terms of what&#8217;s useful for people today, I think most people would prefer to be able to just control mouse and keyboard inputs, to all the applications that they want to use for their daily jobs, for communicating with their friends, et cetera.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=19907">(05:31:47)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And so the job of the application is really to translate this wireless stream of brain data, coming off the implant, into control of the computer. And we do that by essentially building a mapping from brain activity to sort of the HID inputs, to the actual hardware. So HID is just the protocol for communicating like input device events, so for example, move mouse to this position or press this key down. And so that mapping is fundamentally what the app is responsible for. But there&#8217;s a lot of nuance of how that mapping works, and we spent a lot of time to try to get it right, and we&#8217;re still in the early stages of a long journey to figure out how to do that optimally.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So one part of that process is decoding. So decoding is this process of taking the statistical patterns of brain data, that&#8217;s being channeled across this Bluetooth connection to the application. And turning it into, for example, a mouse movement. And that decoding step, you can think of it in a couple of different parts. So similar to any machine learning problem, there&#8217;s a training step, and there&#8217;s an [inaudible 05:32:39] step. The training step in our case is a very intricate behavioral process where the user has to imagine doing different actions. So for example, they&#8217;ll be presented a screen with a cursor on it, and they&#8217;ll be asked to push that cursor to the right. Then imagine pushing that cursor to the left, push it up, push it down. And we can basically build up a pattern or using any sort of modern ML method of mapping of given this brain data, and then imagine behavior, map one to the other.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then at test time you take that same pattern matching system. In our case it&#8217;s a deep neural network, and you run it and you take the live stream of brain data coming off their implant, you decode it by pattern matching to what you saw at calibration time, and you use that for a control of the computer. Now a couple sort of rabbit holes that I think are quite interesting. One of them has to do with how you build that best template matching system. Because there&#8217;s a variety of behavioral challenges and also debugging challenges when you&#8217;re working with someone who&#8217;s paralyzed.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Because again, fundamentally you don&#8217;t observe what they&#8217;re trying to do, you can&#8217;t see them attempt to move their hand. And so you have to figure out a way to instruct the user to do something, and validate that they&#8217;re doing it correctly, such that then you can downstream, build with confidence, the mapping between the neural spikes and the intended action.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And by doing the action correctly, what I really mean is, at this level of resolution of what neurons are doing. So if, in ideal world, you could get a signal of behavioral intent that is ground truth accurate at the scale of one millisecond resolution, then with high confidence, I could build a mapping from my neural spikes, to that behavioral intention. But the challenge is again, that you don&#8217;t observe what they&#8217;re actually doing. And so there&#8217;s a lot of nuance to how you build user experiences, that give you more than just a course on average correct representation of what the user&#8217;s intending to do.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">If you want to build the world&#8217;s best mouse, you really want it to be as responsive as possible. You want it to be able to do exactly what the user&#8217;s intending, at every step along the way, not just on average be correct, when you&#8217;re trying to move it from left to right. And building a behavioral calibration game, or our software experience, that gives you that level of resolution, is what we spend a lot of time working on.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So the calibration process, the interface, has to encourage precision. Meaning whatever it does, it should be super intuitive that the next thing the human is going to likely do, is exactly that intention that you need, and only that intention?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You said something that I think is worth exploring there a little bit. You said it&#8217;s primarily a UX challenge, and I think a large component of it is, but there is also a very interesting machine learning challenge here. Which is given some dataset, including some on average correct behavior, of asking the user to move up, or move down, move right, move left, and given a dataset of neural spikes. Is there a way to infer, in some kind of semi-supervised, or entirely unsupervised way, what that high resolution version of their intention is?</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And if you think about it, there probably is, because there are enough data points in the dataset, enough constraints on your model. That there should be a way with the right sort of formulation, to let the model figure out itself, for example&#8230; At this millisecond, this is exactly how hard they&#8217;re pushing upwards, and at this millisecond, this is how hard they&#8217;re trying to push upwards.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s really important to have very clean labels, yes? So the problem becomes much harder from the machine learning perspective if the labels are noisy?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then to get the clean labels, that&#8217;s a UX challenge?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Correct. Although clean labels, I think maybe it&#8217;s worth exploring what that exactly means. I think any given labeling strategy will have some number of assumption to make, about what the user is attempting to do. Those assumptions can be formulated in a loss function, or they can be formulated in terms of heuristics that you might use, to just try to estimate or guesstimate what the user&#8217;s trying to do. And what really matters is, how accurate are those assumptions? For example, you might say, &#8220;Hey, user, push upwards and follow the speed of this cursor.&#8221; And your heuristic might be that they&#8217;re trying to do exactly what that cursor is trying to do.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">Another competing heuristic might be, they&#8217;re actually trying to go slightly faster at the beginning of the movement and slightly slower at the end. And those competing heuristics may or may not be accurate reflections of what the user is trying to do. Another version of the task might be, &#8220;Hey, user, imagine moving this cursor a fixed offset.&#8221; So rather than follow the cursor, just try to move it exactly 200 pixels to the right. So here&#8217;s the cursor, here&#8217;s the target, okay, cursor disappears, try to move that now invisible cursor, 200 pixels to the right. And the assumption in that case would be that the user can&#8217;t actually modulate correctly that position offset.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">But that position offset assumption might be a weaker assumption, and therefore potentially, you can make it more accurate, than these heuristics that are trying to guesstimate at each millisecond what the user&#8217;s trying to do. So you can imagine different tasks that make different assumptions about the nature of the user intention. And those assumptions being correct is what I would think of as a clean label.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">For that step, what are we supposed to be visualizing? There&#8217;s a cursor, and you want to move that cursor to the right, or the left, or up and down, or maybe move them by a certain offset. So that&#8217;s one way. Is that the best way to do calibration?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So for example, an alternative crazy way that probably is playing a role here, is a game like WEG Grid.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Great question. There&#8217;s a lot to unpack there. So the first thing I would draw a distinction between is, open loop versus closed loop. So open loop, what I mean by that is, the user is sort of going from zero to one. They have no model at all, and they&#8217;re trying to get to the place where they have some level of control, at all. In that setup, you really need to have some task that gives the user a hint of what you want them to do, such that you can build its mapping again, from brain data to output. Then once they have a model, you could imagine them using that model and actually adapting to it, and figuring out the right way to use it themself. And then retraining on that data to give you sort of a boost in performance.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=20354">(05:39:14)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s a lot of challenges associated with both of these techniques, and we can rabbit hole into both of them if you&#8217;re interested. But the sort of challenge with the open loop task is that the user themself doesn&#8217;t get proprioceptive feedback about what they&#8217;re doing. They don&#8217;t necessarily perceive themself or feel the mouse under their hand, when they&#8217;re trying to do an open loop calibration. They&#8217;re being asked to perform something&#8230; Imagine if you sort of had your whole right arm numbed, and you stuck it in a box and you couldn&#8217;t see it, so you had no visual feedback and you had no proprioceptive feedback, about what the position or activity of your arm was.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=20387">(05:39:47)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And now you&#8217;re asked, &#8220;Okay, given this thing on the screen, that&#8217;s moving from left to right, match that speed?&#8221; And you basically can try your best to invoke whatever that imagined action is in your brain, that&#8217;s moving the cursor from left to right. But in any situation, you&#8217;re going to be inaccurate and maybe inconsistent in how you do that task. And so that&#8217;s sort of the fundamental challenge of open loop. The challenge with closed loop is that once the user&#8217;s given a model, and they&#8217;re able to start moving the mouse on their own, they&#8217;re going to very naturally adapt to that model. And that coadaptation between the model learning what they&#8217;re doing, and the user learning how to use the model, may not find you the best sort of global minima.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And maybe that your first model was noisy in some ways, or maybe just had some quirk. There&#8217;s some part of the data distribution, it didn&#8217;t cover super well, and the user now figures out, because they&#8217;re a brilliant user like Noland, they figure out the right sequence of imagined motions, or the right angle they have to hold their hand at to get it to work. And they&#8217;ll get it to work great, but then the next day they come back to their device, and maybe they don&#8217;t remember exactly all the tricks that they used the previous day. And so there&#8217;s a complicated sort of feedback cycle here that can emerge, and can make it a very, very difficulty debugging process.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Okay. There&#8217;s a lot of really fascinating things there. Actually, just to stay on the closed loop&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen situations, this actually happened watching psychology grad students. They used a piece of software and they don&#8217;t know how to program themselves. They used a piece of software that somebody else wrote, and it has a bunch of bugs, and they&#8217;ve been using it for years. They figure out ways to walk around, &#8220;Oh, that just happens.&#8221; Nobody considers, &#8220;Maybe we should fix this.&#8221; They just adapt. And that&#8217;s a really interesting notion, that we&#8217;re really good at it adapting, but that might not be the optimal?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Okay. So how do you solve that problem? Do you have to restart from scratch every once in a while, kind of thing?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. It&#8217;s a good question. First and foremost, I would say this is not a solve problem. And for anyone who&#8217;s listening in academia who works on BCIs, I would also say this is not a problem that&#8217;s solved by simply scaling channel count. So maybe that can help, and you can get sort of richer covariant structures that you can use to exploit, when trying to come up with good labeling strategies. But if you&#8217;re interested in problems that aren&#8217;t going to be solved inherently by scaling channel count, this is one of them.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So how do you solve it? It&#8217;s not a solve problem. That&#8217;s the first thing I want to make sure it gets across. The second thing is, any solution that involves closed loop is going to become a very difficult debugging problem. And one of my general heuristics for choosing what prompts to tackle is, that you want to choose the one that&#8217;s going to be the easiest to debug. Because if you can do that, even if the ceiling is lower, you&#8217;re going to be able to move faster, because you have a tighter iteration loop debugging the problem.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">In the open loop setting, there&#8217;s not a feedback cycle to debug with the user in the loop. And so there&#8217;s some reason to think that, that should be an easier debugging problem. The other thing that&#8217;s worth understanding is that even in the closed loop setting, there&#8217;s no special software magic of how to infer what the user is truly attempting to do. In the closed loop setting, although they&#8217;re moving the cursor on the screen, they may be attempting something different than what your model is outputting. So what the model is outputting is not a signal that you can use to retrain if you want to be able to improve the model further. You still have this very complicated guestimation, or unsupervised problem of figuring out what is the true user intention underlying that signal?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so the open loop problem has the nice property of being easy to debug, and the second nice property of, it has all the same information and content as the closed loop scenario. Another thing I want to mention and call out, is that this problem doesn&#8217;t need to be solved in order to give useful control to people. Even today with the solutions we have now, and that academia has built up over decades, the level of control that can be given to a user today, is quite useful. It doesn&#8217;t need to be solved to get to that level of control.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But again, I want to build the world&#8217;s best mouse. I want to make it so good that it&#8217;s not even a question that you want it. And to build the world&#8217;s best mouse, the superhuman version, you really need to nail that problem. And a couple maybe details of previous studies that we&#8217;ve done internally, that I think are very interesting to understand, when thinking about how to solve this problem. The first is that even when you have ground-truth data of what the user&#8217;s trying to do, and you can get this with an able-bodied monkey, a monkey that has a Neuralink device implanted, and moving a mouse to control a computer. Even with that ground-truth dataset, it turns out that the optimal thing to predict to produce high performance BCI, is not just the direct control of the mouse.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">You can imagine building a dataset of what&#8217;s going on in the brain, and what is the mouse exactly doing on the table? And it turns out that if you build the mapping from neurospikes to predict exactly what the mouse is doing, that model will perform worse, than a model that is trained to predict higher level assumptions about what the user might be trying to do. For example, assuming that the monkey is trying to go in a straight line to the target, it turns out that making those assumptions is actually more effective in producing a model, than actually predicting the underlying hand movement.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So the intention, not the physical movement, or whatever?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s obviously a really strong correlation between the two, but the intention is a more powerful thing to be chasing?</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Well, that&#8217;s also super interesting. I mean, the intention itself is fascinating because yes, with the BCI here in this case with the digital telepathy, you&#8217;re acting on the intention, not the action. Which is why there&#8217;s an experience of feeling like it&#8217;s happening before you meant for it to happen? That is so cool. And that is why you could achieve superhuman performance problem, in terms of the control of the mouse? So for open loop, just to clarify, so whenever the person is tasked to move the mouse to the right, you said there&#8217;s not feedback, so they don&#8217;t get to get that satisfaction of actually getting it to move? Right?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So you could imagine giving the user feedback on a screen, but it&#8217;s difficult, because at this point you don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re attempting to do. So what can you show them that would basically give them a signal of, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing this correctly or not correctly?&#8221; So let&#8217;s take a very specific example. Maybe your calibration task looks like you&#8217;re trying to move the cursor, a certain position offset. So your instructions to the user are, &#8220;Hey, the cursor&#8217;s here. Now when the cursor disappears, imagine you&#8217;re moving it 200 pixels from where it was, to the right to be over this target.&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">In that kind of scenario, you could imagine coming up with some sort of consistency metric that you could display to the user of, &#8220;Okay, I know what the spike trend looks like on average when you do this action to the right. Maybe I can produce some sort of probabilistic estimate of how likely is that to be the action you took, given the latest trial or trajectory that you imagined?&#8221; And that could give the user some sort of feedback of how consistent are they, across different trials.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">You could also imagine that if the user is prompted with that kind of consistency metric, that maybe they just become more behaviorally engaged to begin with, because the task is kind of boring when you don&#8217;t have any feedback at all. And so there may be benefits to the user experience of showing something on the screen, even if it&#8217;s not accurate. Just because it keeps the user motivated to try to increase that number, or push it upwards.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And again, all of that is UX challenge? How much signal drift is there hour-to-hour, day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month? How often do you have to recalibrate because of the signal drift?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So this is a problem we&#8217;ve worked on both with NHP, non-human primates, before our clinical trial, and then also with Noland during the clinical trial. Maybe the first thing that&#8217;s worth stating is what the goal is here. So the goal is really to enable the user to have a plug and play experience&#8230; Well, I guess they don&#8217;t have to plug anything in, but a play experience where they can use the device whenever they wanted, however they want to. And that&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re aiming for. And so there can be a set of solutions that get to that state without considering this non-stationary problem.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So maybe the first solution here that&#8217;s important, is that they can recalibrate whenever they want. This is something that Noland has the ability to do today, so he can recalibrate the system at 2:00 AM, in the middle of the night without his caretaker, or parents or friends around, to help push a button for him. The other important part of the solution is that when you have a good model calibrated, that you can continue using that without needing to recalibrate it. So how often he has to do this recalibration to-date, depends really on his appetite for performance.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">We observe sort of a degradation through time, of how well any individual model works, but this can be mitigated behaviorally by the user adapting their control strategy. It can also be mitigated through a combination of software features that we provide to the user. For example, we let the user adjust exactly how fast the cursor is moving. We call that the gain, for example, the gain of how fast the cursor reacts to any given input intention.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">They can also adjust the smoothing, how smooth the output of that cursor intention actually is. That can also adjust the friction, which is how easy is it to stop and hold still? And all these software tools allow the user a great deal of flexibility and troubleshooting mechanisms to be able to solve this problem for themselves.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I mean, it&#8217;s a really well done interface. It&#8217;s really, really well done. And so there&#8217;s that bias that there&#8217;s a cursor drift that Noland talked about in a stream. Although he said that you guys were just playing around with it with him, and then constantly improving. So that could have been just a snapshot of that particular moment, a particular day, where he said that there was this cursor drift and this bias that could be removed by him. I guess, looking to the right side of the screen, or left side of the screen, to adjust the bias?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So this is actually an idea that comes out of academia. There is some prior work with BrainGate clinical trial participants where they pioneered this idea of bias correction. The way we&#8217;ve done it, I think is, it&#8217;s very prioritized, very beautiful user experience. Where the user can essentially flash the cursor over to the side of the screen, and it opens up a window, where they can actually adjust or tune exactly the bias of the cursor. So bias, maybe for people who aren&#8217;t familiar, is just sort of what is the default motion of the cursor, if you&#8217;re imagining nothing? And it turns out that, that&#8217;s one of the first sort-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; and it turns out that that&#8217;s one of the first qualia of the cursor control experience that&#8217;s impacted by neuron [inaudible 05:50:07]</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s very poetic. I love it. The qualia of the cursor experience. Yeah, I mean it sounds poetic, but it is deeply true. There is an experience. When it works well, it is a joyful&#8230; A really pleasant experience. And when it doesn&#8217;t work well, it&#8217;s a very frustrating experience. That&#8217;s actually the art of UX, you have the possibility to frustrate people, or the possibility to give them joy.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And at the end of the day, it really is truly the case that UX is how the thing works. And so it&#8217;s not just what&#8217;s showing on the screen, it&#8217;s also, what control surfaces does a decoder provide the user? We want them to feel like they&#8217;re in the F1 car, not like some minivan. And that really truly is how we think about it. Noland himself is an F1 fan. We refer to ourself as a pit crew, he really is truly the F1 driver. And there&#8217;s different control surfaces that different kinds of cars and airplanes provide the user, and we take a lot of inspiration from that when designing how the cursor should behave.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And maybe one nuance of this is, even details like when you move a mouse on a MacBook trackpad, the sort of response curve of how that input that you give the trackpad translates to cursor movement is different than how it works with a mouse. When you move on the trackpad, there&#8217;s a different response function, a different curve to how much a movement translates to input to the computer than when you do it physically with a mouse. And that&#8217;s because somebody sat down a long time ago, when they&#8217;re designing the initial input systems to any computer, and they thought through exactly how it feels to use these different systems. And now we&#8217;re designing the next generation of this, input system to a computer, which is entirely done via the brain, and there&#8217;s no proprioceptive feedback, again, you don&#8217;t feel the mouse in your hand, you don&#8217;t feel the keys under your fingertips, and you want a control surface that still makes it easy and intuitive for the user to understand the state of the system, and how to achieve what they want to achieve. And ultimately the end goal is that that UX is completely&#8230; It fades in the background, it becomes something that&#8217;s so natural and intuitive that it&#8217;s subconscious to the user, and they just should feel like they have basically direct control over the cursor, just does what they want it to do. They&#8217;re not thinking about the implementation of how to make it do what they want it to do, it&#8217;s just doing what they want it to do.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Is there some kind of things along the lines of like Fitt&#8217;s Law, where you should move the mouse in a certain kind of way that maximizes your chance to hit the target? I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m asking, but I&#8217;m hoping the intention of my question will land on a profound answer. No. Is there some kind of understanding of the laws of UX when it comes to the context of somebody using their brain to control it that&#8217;s different than with a mouse?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think we&#8217;re in the early stages of discovering those laws, so I wouldn&#8217;t claim to have solved that problem yet, but there&#8217;s definitely some things we&#8217;ve learned that make it easier for the user to get stuff done. And it&#8217;s pretty straightforward when you verbalize it, but it takes a while to actually get to that point, when you&#8217;re in the process of debugging the stuff in the trenches.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">One of those things is that any machine learning system that you build has some number of errors, and it matters how those errors translate to the downstream user experience. For example, if you&#8217;re developing a search algorithm in your photos, if you search for your friend, Joe, and it pulls up a photo of your friend, Josephine, maybe that&#8217;s not a big deal, because the cost of an error is not that high. In a different scenario, where you&#8217;re trying to detect insurance fraud or something like this, and you&#8217;re directly sending someone to court because of some machine learning model output, then the errors make a lot more sense to be careful about, you want to be very thoughtful about how those errors translate to downstream effects.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">The same is true in BCI. So for example, if you&#8217;re building a model that&#8217;s decoding a velocity output from the brain, versus an output where you&#8217;re trying to modulate the left click for example, these have sort of different trade-offs of how precise you need to be before it becomes useful to the end user. For velocity, it&#8217;s okay to be on average correct, because the output of the model is integrated through time. So if the user&#8217;s trying to click at position A, and they&#8217;re currently position B, they&#8217;re trying to navigate over time to get between those two points. And as long as the output of the model is on average correct, they can sort of steer it through time, with the user control loop in the mix, they can get to the point they want to get to.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">The same is not true of a click. For a click, you&#8217;re performing it almost instantly, at the scale of neurons firing. And so you want to be very sure that that click is correct, because a false click can be very destructive to the user. They might accidentally close the tab that they&#8217;re trying to do something in, and lose all their progress. They might accidentally hit some send button on some text that there&#8217;s only half composed and reads funny after. So there&#8217;s different sort of cost functions associated with errors in this space, and part of the UX design is understanding how to build a solution that is, when it&#8217;s wrong, still useful to the end user.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s so fascinating, assigning cost to every action when an error occurs. So every action, if an error occurs, has a certain cost, and incorporating that into how you interpret the intention, mapping it to the action is really important. I didn&#8217;t quite, until you said it, realize there&#8217;s a cost to sending the text early. It&#8217;s a very expensive cost.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it&#8217;s super annoying if you accidentally&#8230; Imagine if your cursor misclicked every once in a while. That&#8217;s super obnoxious. And the worst part of it is, usually when the user&#8217;s trying to click, they&#8217;re also holding still, because they&#8217;re over the target they want to hit, and they&#8217;re getting ready to click, which means that in the datasets that we build, on average is the case that sort of low speeds, or desire to hold still, is correlated with when the user&#8217;s attempting to click.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">People think that, &#8220;Oh, a click is a binary signal, this must be super easy to decode.&#8221; Well, yes, it is, but the bar is so much higher for it to become a useful thing for the user. And there&#8217;s ways to solve this. I mean, you can sort of take the compound approach of, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s take five seconds to click. Let&#8217;s take a huge window of time, so we can be very confident about the answer.&#8221; But again, world&#8217;s best mouse. The world&#8217;s best mouse doesn&#8217;t take a second to click, or 500 milliseconds to click, it takes five milliseconds to click or less. And so if you&#8217;re aiming for that kind of high bar, then you really want to solve the underlying problem.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So maybe this is a good place to ask about how to measure performance, this whole bits per second. Can you explain what you mean by that? Maybe a good place to start is to talk about Webgrid as a game, as a good illustration of the measurement of performance.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Maybe I&#8217;ll take one zoom out step there, which is just explaining why we care to measure this at all. So again, our goal is to provide the user the ability to control the computer as well as I can, and hopefully better. And that means that they can do it at the same speed as what I can do, it means that they have access to all the same functionality that I have, including all those little details like command tab, command space, all this stuff, they need to be able to do it with their brain, and with the same level of reliability as what I can do with my muscles. And that&#8217;s a high bar, and so we intend to measure and quantify every aspect of that to understand how we&#8217;re progressing towards that goal.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s many ways to measure BPS by the way, this isn&#8217;t the only way, but we present the user a grid of targets, and basically we compute a score which is dependent on how fast and accurate they can select, and then how small are the targets. And the more targets that are on the screen, the smaller they are, the more information you present per click. And so if you think about it from information theory point of view, you can communicate across different information theoretic channels, and one such channel is a typing interface, you can imagine, that&#8217;s built out of a grid, just like a software keyboard on the screen.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">And bits per second is a measure that&#8217;s computed by taking the log of the number of targets on the screen. You can subtract one if you care to model a keyboard, because you have to subtract one for the delete key on the keyboard. But log of the number of targets on the screen, times the number of correct selections, minus incorrect, divided by some time window, for example, 60 seconds. And that&#8217;s sort of the standard way to measure a cursor control task in academia. And all credit in the world goes to this great professor, Dr. Shenoy of Stanford who came up with that task, and he&#8217;s also one of my inspirations for being in the field. So all the credit in the world to him for coming up with a standardized metric to facilitate this kind of bragging rights that we have now to say that Noland is the best in the world at this task with this BCI. It&#8217;s very important for progress that you have standardized metrics that people can compare across. Different techniques and approaches, how well does this do? So big kudos to him and to all the team at Stanford.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so for Noland, and for me playing this task, there&#8217;s also different modes that you can configure this task. So the Webgrid task can be presented as just sort of a left click on the screen, or you could have targets that you just dwell over, or you could have targets that you left, right click on, you could have targets that are left, right click, middle click, scrolling, clicking and dragging. You can do all sorts of things within this general framework, but the simplest, purest form is just blue targets show up on the screen, blue means left click. That&#8217;s the simplest form of the game.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the sort of prior records here in academic work and at Neuralink internally with NHPs have all been matched or beaten by Noland with his Neuralink device. So prior to Neuralink, the world record for a human using device is somewhere between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS, depending on exactly what paper you read and how you interpret it. Noland&#8217;s current record is 8.5 BPS. and again, this sort of median Neuralinker performance is 10 BPS. So you can think of it roughly as, he&#8217;s 85% the level of control of a median Neuralinker using their cursor to select blue targets on the screen.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think there&#8217;s a very interesting journey ahead to get us to that same level of 10 BPS performance. It&#8217;s not the case that the tricks that got us from 4 to 6 BPS, and then 6 to 8 BPS are going to be the ones that get us from 8 to 10. And in my view, the core challenge here is really the labeling problem. It&#8217;s how do you understand, at a very, very fine resolution, what the user&#8217;s attempting to do? And I highly encourage folks in academia to work on this problem.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">What&#8217;s the journey with Noland on that quest of increasing the BPS on Webgrid? In March, you said that he selected 89,285 targets in Webgrid. So he loves this game, he&#8217;s really serious about improving his performance in this game. So what is that journey of trying to figure out how to improve that performance? How much can that be done on the decoding side? How much can that be done on the calibration side? How much can that be done on the Noland side of figuring out how to convey his intention more cleanly?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. No, this is a great question. So in my view, one of the primary reasons why Noland&#8217;s performance is so good is because of Noland. Noland is extremely focused and very energetic. He&#8217;ll play Webgrid sometimes for four hours in the middle of the night. From 2:00 A.M. To 6:00 A.M. he&#8217;ll be playing Webgrid, just because he wants to push it to the limits of what he can do. This is not us asking him to do that, I want to be clear. We&#8217;re not saying, &#8221; Hey, you should play Webgrid tonight.&#8221; We just gave him the game as part of our research, and he is able to play it independently, and practice whenever he wants, and he really pushes hard to push it, the technology&#8217;s absolute limit. And he views that as his job, really, to make us be the bottleneck. And boy, has he done that well.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And so the first thing to acknowledge is that he&#8217;s extremely motivated to make this work. I&#8217;ve also had the privilege to meet other clinical trial participants from BrainGate and other trials, and they very much shared the same attitude of, they viewed this as their life&#8217;s work to advance the technology as much as they can. And if that means selecting targets on the screen for four hours from 2:00 A.M. to 6:00 A.M., then so be it. And there&#8217;s something extremely admirable about that that&#8217;s worth calling out.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Okay, so then how do you get from where he started, which is no cursor control to eight BPS? I mean, when he started, there&#8217;s a huge amount of learning to do on his side and our side to figure out what&#8217;s the most intuitive control for him. And the most intuitive control for him is, you have to find the set intersection of, &#8220;Do we have the signal to decode?&#8221; So we don&#8217;t pick up every single neuron in the motor cortex, which means we don&#8217;t have representation for every part of the body. So there may be some signals that we have better decode performance on than others. For example, on his left hand, we have a lot of difficulty distinguishing his left ring finger from his left middle finger, but on his right hand, we have a good control and good modulation detected from the neurons that were able to record for his pinky, and his thumb, and his index finger. So you can imagine how these different subspaces of modulated activity intersect with what&#8217;s the most intuitive for him.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And this has evolved over time, so once we gave him the ability to calibrate models on his own, he was able to go and explore various different ways to imagine controlling the cursor. For example, he can imagine controlling the cursor by wiggling his wrist side to side, or by moving his entire arm, by&#8230; I think at one point he did his feet. He tried a whole bunch of stuff to explore the space of what is the most natural way for him to control the cursor, that at the same time, it&#8217;s easy for us to decode-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Just to clarify, it&#8217;s through the body mapping procedure there, you&#8217;re able to figure out which finger he can move?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes. Yeah, that&#8217;s one way to do it. Maybe one nuance of the&#8230; When he&#8217;s doing it, he can imagine many more things than we represent in that visual on the screen. So we show him, sort of abstractly, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a cursor. You figure out what works the best for you.&#8221; And we obviously have hints about what will work best from that body mapping procedure, of, &#8220;We know that this particular action we can represent well.&#8221; But it&#8217;s really up to him to go and explore and figure out what works the best.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So this happened on a Tuesday. I remember this day very clearly, because at some point during the day, it looked like he wasn&#8217;t doing super well, it looked like the model wasn&#8217;t performing super well, and he was getting distracted, but actually, it wasn&#8217;t the case. What actually happened was, he was trying something new, where he was just controlling the cursor, so he wasn&#8217;t imagining moving his hand anymore, he was just imagining&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what it is, some abstract intention to move the cursor on the screen, and I cannot tell you what the difference between those two things are, I truly cannot. He&#8217;s tried to explain it to me before, I cannot give a first-person account of what that&#8217;s like. But the expletives that he uttered in that moment were enough to suggest that it was a very qualitatively different experience for him to just have direct neural control over a cursor.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">I wonder if there&#8217;s a way through UX to encourage a human being to discover that, because he discovered it&#8230; Like you said to me, that he&#8217;s a pioneer. So he discovered that on his own through all of this, the process of trying to move the cursor with different kinds of intentions. But that is clearly a really powerful thing to arrive at, which is to let go of trying to control the fingers and the hand, and control the actual digital device with your mind.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s right. UX is how it works. And the ideal UX is one that the user doesn&#8217;t have to think about what they need to do in order to get it done, it just does it.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">That is so fascinating. But I wonder, on the biological side, how long it takes for the brain to adapt. So is it just simply learning high level software, or is there a neuroplasticity component where the brain is adjusting slowly?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. The truth is, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m very excited to see with sort of the second participant that I implant, what the journey is like for them, because we&#8217;ll have learned a lot more, potentially, we can help them understand and explore that direction more quickly. This wasn&#8217;t me prompting Noland to go try this, he was just exploring how to use his device and figured it out himself. But now that we know that that&#8217;s a possibility, that maybe there&#8217;s a way to, for example, hint the user, &#8220;Don&#8217;t try super hard during calibration, just do something that feels natural.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Just directly control the cursor. Don&#8217;t imagine explicit action.&#8221; And from there, we should be able to hopefully understand how this is for somebody who has not experienced that before. Maybe that&#8217;s the default mode of operation for them, you don&#8217;t have to go through this intermediate phase of explicit motions.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Or maybe if that naturally happens for people, you can just occasionally encourage them to allow themselves to move the cursor.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, and share. And that because of them sharing it, they&#8217;ll be able to do it. All of a sudden that&#8217;s unlocked for everybody, because just the knowledge sometimes is the thing that enables you to do it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Just to comment on that too, we&#8217;ve probably tried 1,000 different ways to do various aspects of decoding, and now we know what the right subspace is to continue exploring further. Again, thanks to Noland and the many hours he&#8217;s put into this. And so even just that, help constraints, or the beam search of different approaches that we could explore really helps accelerate for the next person the set of things that we&#8217;ll get to try on day one, how fast we hopefully get them to use for control, how fast we can enable them to use it independently, and to get value out of the system. So massive hats off to Noland and all the participants that came before to make this technology a reality.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So how often are the updates to the decoder? &#8216;Cause Noland mentioned, &#8220;Okay, there&#8217;s a new update that we&#8217;re working on.&#8221; In the stream he said he plays the snake game, because it&#8217;s super hard, it&#8217;s a good way for him to test how good the update is. And he says sometimes the update is a step backwards, it&#8217;s a constant iteration. What does the update entail? Is it mostly on the decoder side?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Couple of comments. So, one, it&#8217;s probably worth drawing distinction between research sessions where we&#8217;re actively trying different things to understand what the best approach is, versus independent use, where we wanted to have ability to just go use the device how anybody would want to use their MacBook. So what he&#8217;s referring to is, I think, usually in the context of a research session, where we&#8217;re trying many, many different approaches to&#8230; Even unsupervised approaches, like we talked about earlier, to try to come up with better ways to estimate his true intention, and more accurately decoded.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">And in those scenarios, we try, in any given session&#8230; He&#8217;ll sometimes work for eight hours a day, and so that can be hundreds of different models that we would try in that day. A lot of different things. Now, it&#8217;s also worth noting that we update the application he uses quite frequently, I think sometimes up to 4 or 5 times a day, we&#8217;ll update his application with different features, or bug fixes, or feedback that he&#8217;s given us.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">He&#8217;s a very articulate person who is part of the solution, he&#8217;s not a complaining person, he says, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s this thing that I&#8217;ve discovered is not optimal in my flow. Here&#8217;s some ideas how to fix it. Let me know what your thoughts are, let&#8217;s figure out how to solve it.&#8221; And it often happens that those things are addressed within a couple of hours of him giving us his feedback, that&#8217;s the kind of iteration cycle we&#8217;ll have. And so sometimes at the beginning of the session, he&#8217;ll give us feedback, and at the end of the session he&#8217;s giving us feedback on the next iteration of that process or that setup.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s fascinating, &#8217;cause one of the things you mentioned that there was 271 pages of notes taken from the BCI sessions, and this was just in March.

Just to brag on the team a little bit, I work with a lot of exceptional people, and it requires the team being absolutely laser-focused on the user, and what will be the best for them. And it requires a level of commitment of, &#8220;Okay, this is what the user feedback was. I have all these meetings, we&#8217;re going to skip that today, and we&#8217;re going to do this.&#8221; That level of focus and commitment is, I would say, underappreciated in the world. And also, you obviously have to have the talent to be able to execute on these things effectively, and we have that in loads.</span>

Sometimes you really need to step back and think globally, &#8220;Am I even in the right sort of minima to be chasing down for a solution?&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot of problems in which sort of fast iteration cycle is the predictor of how successful you&#8217;ll be. As a good example, like in an RL simulation for example, the more frequently you get reward, the faster you can progress. It&#8217;s just an easier learning problem the more frequently you get feedback. But UX is not that way, I mean, users are actually quite often wrong about what the right solution is, and it requires a deep understanding of the technical system, and what&#8217;s possible, combined with what the problem is you&#8217;re trying to solve. Not just how the user expressed it, but what the true underlying problem is to actually get to the right place.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, that&#8217;s the old stories of Steve Jobs rolling in there, like, &#8220;Yeah, the user is a useful signal, but it&#8217;s not a perfect signal, and sometimes you have to remove the floppy disc drive.&#8221; Or whatever the&#8230; I forgot all the crazy stories of Steve Jobs making wild design decisions. But there, some of it is aesthetic, that some of it is about the love you put into the design, which is very much a Steve Jobs, Johnny Ive type thing, but when you have a human being using their brain to interact with it, it also is deeply about function, it&#8217;s not just aesthetic. And that, you have to empathize with a human being before you, while not always listening to them directly. You have to deeply empathize. It&#8217;s fascinating. It&#8217;s really, really fascinating. And at the same time, iterate, but not iterate in small ways, sometimes a complete&#8230; Like rebuilding the design. Noland said in the early days the UX sucked, but you improved quickly. What was that journey like?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. And maybe it&#8217;s also worth calling out, there are other alternative assisted technologies, but the particular situation Noland&#8217;s in, and this is not uncommon, and I think it&#8217;s also not well-understood by folks, is that he&#8217;s relatively spastic, so he&#8217;ll have muscle spasms from time to time. And so any assistive technology that requires him to be positioned directly in front of a camera, for example, an eye tracker, or anything that requires him to put something in his mouth just is a no-go, &#8217;cause he&#8217;ll either be shifted out of frame when he has a spasm, or if he has something in his mouth, it&#8217;ll stab him in the face if he spasms too hard. So these kinds of considerations are important when thinking about what advantages a BCI has in someone&#8217;s life. If it fits ergonomically into your life in a way that you can use it independently when your caretakers not there, wherever you want to, either in the bed or in the chair, depending on your comfort level and your desire to have pressure source, all these factors matter a lot in how good the solution is in that user&#8217;s life.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So one of these very fun examples is scroll. So, again, manga is something he wanted to be able to read, and there&#8217;s many ways to do scroll with a BCI. You can imagine different gestures, for example, the user could do that would move the page. But scroll is a very fascinating control surface, because it&#8217;s a huge thing on the screen in front of you. So any sort of jitter in the model output, any sort of air in the model output causes an earthquake on the screen. You really don&#8217;t want to have your mango page that you&#8217;re trying to read be shifted up and down a few pixels just because your scroll decoder is not completely accurate.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=22459">(06:14:19)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And so this was an example where we had to figure out how to formulate the problem in a way that the errors of the system, whenever they do occur, and we&#8217;ll do our best to minimize them, but whenever those errors do occur, that it doesn&#8217;t interrupt the qualia, again, of the experience that the user is having. It doesn&#8217;t interrupt their flow of reading their book. And so what we ended up building is this really brilliant feature. This is a teammate named Bruce who worked on this really brilliant work called Quick Scroll. And Quick Scroll basically looks at the screen, and it identifies where on the screen are scroll bars. And it does this by deeply integrated with macOS to understand where are the scroll bars actively present on the screen, using the sort of accessibility tree that&#8217;s available to macOS apps. And we identified where those scroll bars are, and we provided a BCI scroll bar, and the BCI scroll bar looks similar to a normal scroll bar, but it behaves very differently, in that once you move over to it, your cursor sort of morphs onto it, it sort of attaches or latches onto it. And then once you push up or down, in the same way that you&#8217;d use a push to control the normal cursor, it actually moves the screen for you. So it&#8217;s basically like remapping the velocity to a scroll action.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=22526">(06:15:26)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And the reason that feels so natural and intuitive is that when you move over to attach to it feels like magnetic, so you&#8217;re sort of stuck onto it, and then it&#8217;s one continuous action, you don&#8217;t have to switch your imagined movement, you sort of snap onto it, and then you&#8217;re good to go. You just immediately can start pulling the page down or pushing it up. And even once you get that right, there&#8217;s so many little nuances of how the scroll behavior works to make it natural and intuitive. So one example is momentum. When you scroll a page with your fingers on the screen, you actually have some flow, it doesn&#8217;t just stop right when you lift your finger up. The same is true with BCI scroll, so we had to spend some time to figure out, &#8220;What are the right nuances when you don&#8217;t feel the screen under your fingertip anymore? What is the right sort of dynamic, or what&#8217;s the right amount of page give, if you will, when you push it to make it flow the right amount for the user to have a natural experience reading their book?&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=22575">(06:16:15)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">I could tell you there&#8217;s so many little minutia of how exactly that scroll works, that we spent probably a month getting right, to make that feel extremely natural and easy for the user to navigate.</span>
        </div>

            <span class="ts-text">I mean, even the scroll on a smartphone with your finger feels extremely natural and pleasant, and it probably takes an extremely long time to get that right. And actually, the same kind of visionary UX design that we were talking about, don&#8217;t always listen to the users, but also listen to them, and also have visionary, big, like throw everything out, think from first principles, but also not. Yeah, yeah. By the way, it just makes me think that scroll bars on the desktop probably have stagnated, and never taken that&#8230; &#8216;Cause the snap, same as snap to grid, snap to scroll bar action you&#8217;re talking about is something that could potentially be extremely useful in the desktop setting, even just for users to just improve the experience. &#8216;Cause the current scroll bar experience in the desktop is horrible.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s hard to find, hard to control, there&#8217;s not a momentum, there&#8217;s&#8230; And the intention should be clear, when I start moving towards a scroll bar, there should be a snapping to the scroll bar action, but of course&#8230; Maybe I&#8217;m okay paying that cost, but there&#8217;s hundreds of millions of people paying that cost non-stop, but anyway. But in this case, this is necessary, because there&#8217;s an extra cost paid by Noland for the jitteriness, so you have to switch between the scrolling and the reading. There has to be a face shift between the two, like when you&#8217;re scrolling, you&#8217;re scrolling.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Right, right. So that is one drawback of the current approach. Maybe one other just sort of case study here. So, again, UX is how it works, and we think about that holistically, from the&#8230; Even the feature detection level of what we detect in the brain, to how we design the decoder, what we choose to decode, to then how it works once it&#8217;s being used by the user. So another good example in that sort of how it works once they&#8217;re actually using the decoder, the output that&#8217;s displayed on the screen is not just what the decoder says, it&#8217;s also a function of what&#8217;s going on on the screen.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So we can understand, for example, that when you&#8217;re trying to close a tab, that very small, stupid little X that&#8217;s extremely tiny, which is hard to get precisely hit, if you&#8217;re dealing with a noisy output of the decoder, we can understand that that is a small little X you might be trying to hit, and actually make it a bigger target for you. Similar to how when you&#8217;re typing on your phone, if you are used to the iOS keyboard for example, it actually adapts to target size of individual keys based on an underlying language model. So it&#8217;ll actually understand if I&#8217;m typing, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to see L.&#8221; It&#8217;ll make the E key bigger because it knows Lex is the person I&#8217;m going to go see. And so that kind of predictiveness can make the experience much more smooth, even without improvements to the underlying decoder or feature detection part of the stack.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So we do that with a feature called magnetic targets, we actually index the screen, and we understand, &#8220;Okay, these are the places that are very small targets that might be difficult to hit. Here&#8217;s the kind of cursor dynamics around that location that might be indicative of the user trying to select it. Let&#8217;s make it easier. Let&#8217;s blow up the size of it in a way that makes it easier for the user to sort of snap onto that target.&#8221; So all these little details, they matter a lot in helping the user be independent in their day-to-day living.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So how much of the work on the decoder is generalizable to P2, P3, P4, P5 PM? How do you improve the decoder in a way that&#8217;s generalizable?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, great question. So the underlying signal we&#8217;re trying to decode is going to look very different in P2 than in P1. For example, channel number 345 is going to mean something different in user one than it will in user two, just because that electrode that corresponds with channel 345 is going to be next to a different neuron in user one to person user two. But the approach is the methods, the user experience of how do you get the right behavioral pattern from the user to associate with that neural signal. We hope that will translate over multiple generations of users.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">And beyond that, it&#8217;s very, very possible, in fact, quite likely that we&#8217;ve overfit to Noland&#8217;s user experience, desires and preferences. And so what I hope to see is that when we get a second, third, fourth participant, that we find what the right wide minimums are that cover all the cases that make it more intuitive for everyone. And hopefully, there&#8217;s a crosspollination of things, where, &#8220;Oh, we didn&#8217;t think about that with this user because they can speak. But with this user who just can fundamentally not speak at all, this user experience is not optimal.&#8221; Those improvements that we make there should hopefully translate then to even people who can speak but don&#8217;t feel comfortable doing so because we&#8217;re in a public setting, like their doctor&#8217;s office.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I don&#8217;t know what the limits&#8230; I mean, the limits, you can calculate just in terms of screen refresh rate and cursor immediately jumping to the next target. I mean, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s limits before that with just sort of reaction time, and visual perception, and things like this. I would guess it&#8217;s below 40, but above 20, somewhere in there is probably the right&#8230; That I&#8217;d never to be thinking about. It also matters how difficult the task is. You can imagine some people might be able to do 10,000 targets on the screen, and maybe they can do better that way. So there&#8217;s some task optimizations you could do to try to boost your performance as well.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; to keep increasing that number. You said every increase in the number might require different improvements in the system.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. The first answer that&#8217;s important to say is, I don&#8217;t know. This is edge of the research so, again, nobody&#8217;s gotten to that number before, so what&#8217;s next is going to be a heuristic guess from my part. What we&#8217;ve seen historically is that different parts of the stack can compile next to different time points. So when I first joined Neuralink, three years ago or so, one of the major problems was just the latency of the Bluetooth connection. The radio in the device wasn&#8217;t super good, it was an early revision of the implant. And it just, no matter how good your decoder was, if your thing is updating every 30 milliseconds or 50 milliseconds, it&#8217;s just going to be choppy. And no matter how good you are, that&#8217;s going to be frustrating and lead to challenges. So at that point, it was very clear that the main challenge is just get the data off the device in a very reliable way such that you can enable the next challenge to be tackled.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=23159">(06:25:59)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">And then at some point it was actually the modeling challenge of how do you just build a good mapping, like the supervised learning problem of, you have a bunch of data and you have a label you&#8217;re trying to predict, just what is the right neural decoder architecture and hyperparameters to optimize that? And that was the problem for a bit, and once you solve that, it became a different bottleneck. I think the next bottleneck after that was actually just software stability and reliability. If you have widely varying inference latency in your system or your app just lags out every once in a while, it decreases your ability to maintain and get in a state of flow, and it basically just disrupts your control experience. And so there&#8217;s a variety of different software bugs and improvements we made that basically increased the performance of the system, made it much more reliable, much more stable and led to a state where we could reliably collect data to build better models with.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=23209">(06:26:49)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">So that was a bottleneck for a while, it was just the software stack itself. If I were to guess right now, there&#8217;s two major directions you could think about for improving VPS further. The first major direction is labeling. So labeling is, again, this fundamental challenge of given a window of time where the user is expressing some behavioral intent, what are they really trying to do at the granularity of every millisecond? And that again, is a task design problem, it&#8217;s a UX problem, it&#8217;s a machine learning problem, it&#8217;s a software problem. It touches all those different domains. The second thing you can think about to improve BPS further is either completely changing the thing you&#8217;re decoding or just extending the number of things that you&#8217;re decoding. So this is serving the direction of functionality, basically, you can imagine giving more clicks.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=23253">(06:27:33)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">For example, a left click, a right click, a middle click, different actions like click-and-drag for example, and that can improve the effective bit rate of your communication processes. If you&#8217;re trying to allow the user to express themselves through any given communication channel, you can measure that with bits per second. But what actually is measured at the end of the day is how effective are they at navigating their computer? So from the perspective of the downstream tasks that you care about, functionality and extending functionality is something we&#8217;re very interested in, because not only can it improve the number of BPS, but it can also improve the downstream independence that the user has and the skill and efficiency with which they can operate their computer.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Would the number of threads increasing also potentially help?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes. Short answer is yes. It&#8217;s a bit nuanced how that manifests in the numbers. So what you&#8217;ll see is that if you plot a curve of number of channels that you&#8217;re using for decode versus either the offline metric of how good you are at decoding or the online metric of in practice how good is the user at using this device, you see roughly a log curve. So as you move further out in number of channels, you get a corresponding logarithmic improvement in control quality and offline validation metrics. The important nuance here is that each channel corresponds with a specific represented intention in the brain. So for example, if you have a channel 254, it might correspond with moving to the right. Channel 256, might mean move to the left. If you want to expand the number of functions you want to control, you really want to have a broader set of channels that covers a broader set of imagined movements. You can think of it like Mr. Potato Man actually, if you had a bunch of different imagined movements you could do, how would you map those imagined movements to input to a computer? You could imagine handwriting to output characters on the screen. You could imagine just typing with your fingers and have that output text on the screen. You could imagine different finger modulations for different clicks. You can imagine wiggling your big nose for opening some menu or wiggling your big toe to have command tab occur or something like this. So it&#8217;s really the amount of different actions you can take in the world depends on how many channels you have on the information content that they carry.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Lex Fridman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Right, so that&#8217;s more about the number of actions. So actually as you increase the number of threads, that&#8217;s more about increasing the number of actions you&#8217;re able to perform.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">But one other nuance there that is worth mentioning. So again, our goal is really to enable a user with paralyzes to control the computer as fast as I can, so that&#8217;s BPS, with all the same functionality I have, which is what we just talked about, but then also as reliably as I can. And that last point is very related to channel account discussion. So as you scale out number of channels, the relative importance of any particular feature of your model input to the output control of the user diminishes, which means that if the neural non-stationarity effect is per channel, or if the noise is independent such that more channels means on average less output effect, then your reliability of your system will improve. So one core thesis that at least I have is that scaling channel account should improve the reliability system without any work on the decoder itself.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Bliss Chapman</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so maybe let&#8217;s talk briefly what the actual underlying signal looks like. So again, I spoke very briefly at the beginning about how when you imagine moving to the right or imagine moving to the left, neurons might fire more or less, and the frequency content that signal, at least in the motor cortex, it&#8217;s very correlated with the output intention, the behavioral task that the user is doing. You can imagine actually this is not obvious that rate coding, which is the name of that phenomenon, is the only way the brain could represent information. You can imagine many different ways in which the brain could encode intention, and there&#8217;s actually evidence in bats for example, that there&#8217;s temporal codes. So timing codes of exactly when particular neurons fire is the mechanism of information representation. But at least in the motor cortex, there&#8217;s substantial evidence that it&#8217;s rate coding or at least first order of effect is that it&#8217;s rate coding.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">So then if the brain is representing information by changing the frequency of a neuron firing, what really matters is the delta between the baseline state of the neuron and what it looks like when it&#8217;s modulated. And what we&#8217;ve observed and what has also been observed in academic work is that that baseline rate, if you&#8217;re to target the scale, if you imagine that analogy for measuring flour or something when you&#8217;re baking, that baseline state of how much the pot weighs is actually different day to day. So if what you&#8217;re trying to measure is how much rice is in the pot, you&#8217;re going to get a different measurement different days because you&#8217;re measuring with different pots. So that baseline rate shifting is really the thing that at least from a first order description of the problem is what&#8217;s causing this downstream bias. There can be other effects, not linear effects on top of that, but at least at a very first order description of the problem. That&#8217;s what we observed day to day is that the baseline firing rate of any particular neuron or observed on a particular channel is changing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So can you just adjust to the baseline to make it relative to the baseline nonstop?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, this is a great question. So with monkeys, we have found various ways to do this. One example way to do this is you ask them to do some behavioral tasks like play the game with a joystick, you measure what&#8217;s going on in the brain. You compute some mean of what&#8217;s going on across all the input features, and you subtract that on the input when you&#8217;re doing your BCI session, works super well. For whatever reason, that doesn&#8217;t work super well with Noland. I actually don&#8217;t know the full reason why, but I can imagine several explanations.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">One such explanation could be that the context effect difference between some open-loop task and some closed-loop task is much more significant with Noland than it is with the monkey. Maybe in this open-loop task, he&#8217;s watching the Lex Fridman Podcast while he&#8217;s doing the task or he&#8217;s whistling and listening to music and talking with his friend and ask his mom what&#8217;s for dinner while he&#8217;s doing this task. So the exact difference in context between those two states may be much larger and thus lead to a bigger generalization gap between the features that you&#8217;re normalizing at open-loop time and what you&#8217;re trying to use at closed-loop time.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s interesting. Just on that point, it&#8217;s incredible to watch Noland be able to multitask, to do multiple tasks at the same time, to be able to move the mouse cursor effectively while talking and while being nervous because he&#8217;s talking in front of [inaudible 06:33:45]</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Maybe one comment on that too. For folks that aren&#8217;t familiar with assistive technology, I think there&#8217;s a common belief that, well, why can&#8217;t you just use an eye tracker or something like this for helping somebody move a mouse on the screen? It&#8217;s really a fair question and one that I actually was not confident before Sir Noland that this was going to be a profoundly transformative technology for people like him. And I&#8217;m very confident now that it will be, but the reasons are subtle. It really has to do with ergonomically how it fits into their life, even if you can just offer the same level of control as what they would have with an eye tracker or with a mouse stick, but you don&#8217;t need to have that thing in your face. You don&#8217;t need to be positioned a certain way.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You don&#8217;t need your caretaker to be around to set it up for you. You can activate it when you want, how you want, wherever you want. That level of independence is so game-changing for people. It means that they can text a friend at night privately without their mom needing to be in the loop. It means that they can open up and browse the internet at 2:00 AM when nobody&#8217;s around to set their iPad up for them. This is a profoundly game-changing thing for folks in that situation, and this is even before we start talking about folks that may not be able to communicate at all or ask for help when they want to. This can be potentially the only link that they have to the outside world. And yeah, that one doesn&#8217;t, I think, need explanation of why that&#8217;s so impactful.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You mentioned NeuroDecodeR. How much machine learning is in the decoder, how much magic, how much science, how much art? How difficult is it to come up with a decoder that figures out what these sequence of spikes mean?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, good question. There&#8217;s a couple of different ways to answer this, so maybe I&#8217;ll zoom out briefly first and then I&#8217;ll go down one of the rabbit holes. So the zoomed out view is that building the decoder is really the process of building the dataset plus compiling it into the weights, and each of those steps is important. The direction I think of further improvement is primarily going to be in the dataset side of how do you construct the optimal labels for the model. But there&#8217;s an entirely separate challenge of then how do you compile the best model? And so I&#8217;ll go briefly down the second rabbit hole. One of the main challenges with designing the optimal model for BCI is that offline metrics don&#8217;t necessarily correspond to online metrics. It&#8217;s fundamentally a control problem. The user is trying to control something on the screen and the exact user experience of how you output the intention impacts their ability to control. So for example, if you just look at validation loss as predicted by your model, there can be multiple ways to achieve the same validation loss.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span> 
            <span class="ts-timestamp"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk9BiPhm7o&#038;t=23786">(06:36:26)</a> </span>
            <span class="ts-text">Not all of them are equally controllable by the end user. And so it might be as simple as saying, oh, you could just add auxiliary loss terms that help you capture the thing that actually matters. But this is a very complex nuanced process. So how you turn the labels into the model is more of a nuanced process than just a standard supervised learning problem. One very fascinating anecdote here, we&#8217;ve tried many different neural network architectures that translate brain data to velocity outputs, for example. And one example that&#8217;s stuck in my brain from a couple of years ago now is at one point, we were using just fully-connected networks to decode the brain activity. We tried A-B test where we were measuring the relative performance in online control sessions of one deconvolution over the input signal. So if you imagine per channel you have a sliding window that&#8217;s producing some convolved feature, for each of those input sequences for every single channel simultaneously, you can actually get better validation metrics, meaning you&#8217;re fitting the data better and it&#8217;s generalizing better in offline data if you use this convolutional architecture. You&#8217;re reducing parameters. It&#8217;s a standard procedure when you&#8217;re dealing with time series data. Now it turns out that when using that model online, the controllability was worse, was far worse, even though the offline metrics were better, and there can be many ways to interpret that. But what that taught me at least was that, hey, it&#8217;s at least the case right now that if you were to just throw a bunch of compute at this problem and you were trying to hyperparameter optimize or let some GPT model hard code or come up with or invent many different solutions, if you were just optimizing for loss, it would not be sufficient, which means that there&#8217;s still some inherent modeling gap here. There&#8217;s still some artistry left to be uncovered here of how to get your model to scale with more compute, and that may be fundamentally a labeling problem, but there may be other components to this as well.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Is it data constraint at this time, which is what it sounds like? How do you get a lot of good labels?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I think it&#8217;s data quality constrained, not necessarily data quantity constrained.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But even just the quantity &#8217;cause it has to be trained on the interactions. I guess there&#8217;s not that many interactions.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so it depends what version of this you&#8217;re talking about. So if you&#8217;re talking about, let&#8217;s say, the simplest example of just 2D velocity, then I think, yeah, data quality is the main thing. If you&#8217;re talking about how to build a multi-function output that lets you do all the inputs the computer that you and I can do, then it&#8217;s actually a much more sophisticated nuanced modeling challenge because now you need to think about not just when the users are left clicking, but when you&#8217;re building the left click model, you also need to be thinking about how to make sure it doesn&#8217;t fire when they&#8217;re trying to right click or when they&#8217;re trying to move the mouse.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So one example of an interesting bug from week one of BCI with Noland was when he moved the mouse, the click signal dropped off a cliff and when he stopped, the click signal went up. So again, there&#8217;s a contamination between the two inputs. Another good example was at one point he was trying to do a left click and drag, and the minute he started moving, the left click signal dropped off a cliff. So again, &#8217;cause some contamination between the two signals, you need to come up with some way to either in the dataset or in the model build robustness against this kind of, you think of it like overfitting, but really it&#8217;s just that the model has not seen this kind of variability before. So you need to find some way to help the model with that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes, it is fundamentally an engineering challenge.

            <span class="ts-text">I think there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m excited about from the technology side and some I&#8217;m excited about for understanding how this technology is going to be best situated for entering the world, so I&#8217;ll work backwards. On the technology entering the world side of things, I&#8217;m really excited to understand how this device works for folks that cannot speak at all, that have no ability to bootstrap themselves into useful control by voice command, for example, and are extremely limited in their current capabilities. I think that will be an incredibly useful signal for us to understand really, what is an existential threat for all startups, which is product market fit. Does this device have the capacity and potential to transform people&#8217;s lives in the current state? And if not, what are the gaps? And if there are gaps, how do we solve them most efficiently?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m very excited about for the next year or so of clinical trial operations. On the technology side, I&#8217;m quite excited about basically everything we&#8217;re doing. I think it&#8217;s going to be awesome. The most prominent one I would say is scaling channel account. So right now we have a 1,000-channel device. The next version we&#8217;ll have between 3 and 6,000 channels, and I would expect that curve to continue in the future. And it&#8217;s unclear what set of problems will just disappear completely at that scale and what set of problems will remain and require for their focus. And so I&#8217;m excited about the clarity of gradient that gives us in terms of the user experiences we choose to focus our time and resources on. And then also in terms of even things as simple as non-stationarity, does that problem just completely go away at that scale? Or do we need to come up with new creative UXes still even at that point?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And also when we get to that time point, when we start expanding out dramatically the set of functions that you can output from one brain how to deal with all the nuances of both the user experience of not being able to feel the different keys under your fingertips, but still needing to be able to modulate all of them in synchrony to achieve the thing you want. And again, you don&#8217;t have that appropriate set of feedback loop, so how can you make that intuitive for a user to control a high dimensional control surface without feeling the thing physically? I think that&#8217;s going to be a super interesting problem. I&#8217;m also quite excited to understand do these scaling laws continue? As you scale channel count, how much further out do you go before that saturation point is truly hit?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And it&#8217;s not obvious today. I think we only know what&#8217;s in the interpolation space. We only know what&#8217;s between 0 and 1,024, but we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s beyond that. And then there&#8217;s a whole range of interesting neuroscience and brain questions, which is, when you stick more stuff in the brain in more places, you get to learn much more quickly about what those brain regions represent. And so I&#8217;m excited about that fundamental neuroscience learning, which is also important for figuring out how to most efficiently insert electrodes in the future. So yeah, I think all those dimensions I&#8217;m really, really excited about. And that doesn&#8217;t even get close to touching the software stack that we work on every single day and what we&#8217;re working on right now.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it seems virtually impossible to me that 1,000 electrodes is where it saturates. It feels like this would be one of those silly notions in the future where obviously you should have millions of electrodes and this is where the true breakthroughs happen. You tweeted, &#8220;Some thoughts are most precisely described in poetry.&#8221; Why do you think that is?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think it&#8217;s because the information bottleneck of language is pretty steep, and yet you&#8217;re able to reconstruct on the other person&#8217;s brain more effectively without being literal. If you can express a sentiment such that in their brain they can reconstruct the actual true underlying meaning and beauty of the thing that you&#8217;re trying to get across, the generator function in their brain is more powerful than what language can express. And so the mechanism of poetry is really just to feed or seed that generator function.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That right. And it&#8217;s actually in the process of the user going through that generation that they understand what you mean. That&#8217;s the beautiful part. It&#8217;s also like when you look at a beautiful painting, it&#8217;s not the pixels of the painting that are beautiful, it&#8217;s the thought process that occurs when you see that, the experience of that, that actually is the thing that matters.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it&#8217;s resonating with some deep thing within you that the artist also experienced and was able to convey that through the pixels.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And that&#8217;s actually going to be relevant for full-on telepathy. It&#8217;s like if you just read the poetry literally, that doesn&#8217;t say much of anything interesting. It requires a human to interpret it. So it&#8217;s the combination of the human mind and all the experiences that a human being has within the context of the collective intelligence of the human species that makes that poem make sense and they load that in. So in that same way, the signal that carries from human to human meaning may seem trivial, but may actually carry a lot of power because of the complexity of the human mind and the receiving end. Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. Who was it? I think Joscha Bach [inaudible 06:45:24] said something about all the people that think we&#8217;ve achieved AGI explain why humans like music.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I don&#8217;t know either. I listen to a lot of classical music and also read a lot of poetry and yeah, I do wonder if there is some element of the next token surprise factor going on there.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Cause a lot of the tricks in both poetry and music are basically you have some repeated structure and then you do a twist. It&#8217;s like, okay, clause 1, 2, 3 is one thing and then clause four is like, &#8220;Okay, now we&#8217;re onto the next theme,&#8221; and they play with exactly when the surprise happens and the expectation of the user. And that&#8217;s even true through history as musicians evolve in music, they take some known structure that people are familiar with and they just tweak it a little bit. They tweak it and add a surprising element. This is especially true in classical music heritage, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m wondering. Is it all just entropy?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There&#8217;s a TV show I really like called The West Wing, and in The West Wing there&#8217;s a character, he&#8217;s the President of the United States who&#8217;s having a discussion about the Bible with one of their colleagues. And the colleague says something about the Bible says X, Y, and Z, and the President says, &#8220;Yeah, but it also says A, B, C.&#8221; The person says, &#8220;Well, do you believe the Bible to be literally true?&#8221; And the President says, &#8220;Yes, but I also think that neither of us are smart enough to understand it.&#8221; I think the analogy here for the meaning of life is that largely we don&#8217;t know the right question to ask.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So I think I&#8217;m very aligned with the Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy version of this question, which is basically, if we can ask the right questions, it&#8217;s much more likely we find the meaning of human existence. So in the short term as a heuristic in the search policy space, we should try to increase the diversity of people asking such questions or generally of consciousness and conscious beings asking such questions. So again, I think I will take the I don&#8217;t know card here, but say I do think there are meaningful things we can do that improve the likelihood of answering that question.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It was a freak thing that happened. Imagine you&#8217;re running into the ocean, although this is a lake, but you&#8217;re running into the ocean and you get to about waist high, and then you dive in, take the rest of the plunge under the wave or something. That&#8217;s what I did, and then I just never came back up. Not sure what happened. I did it running into the water with a couple of guys, and so my idea of what happened is really just that I took a stray fist, elbow, knee, foot, something to the side of my head. The left side of my head was sore for about a month afterwards, so I must&#8217;ve taken a pretty big knock, and then they both came up and I didn&#8217;t. And so I was face down in the water for a while. I was conscious, and then eventually just realized I couldn&#8217;t hold my breath any longer and I keep saying took a big drink.</span>

I am a very relaxed stress-free person. I rolled with the punches for a lot of this. I took it in stride. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right, well, what can I do next? How can I improve my life even a little bit on a day-to-day basis?&#8221; At first, just trying to find some way to heal as much of my body as possible to try to get healed, to try to get off a ventilator, learn as much as I could so I could somehow survive once I left the hospital.

So thankfully, I had my family. I have a great group of friends, a great group of buddies from college who have all rallied around me, and we&#8217;re all still incredibly close. People always say if you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll end up with one or two friends from high school that you keep throughout your life. I have about 10 or 12 from high school that have all stuck around, and we still get together, all of us twice a year. We call it the spring series and the fall series.

I can&#8217;t flip over, can&#8217;t do anything, then I&#8217;m going to drown eventually.&#8221; And I knew I couldn&#8217;t hold my breath forever, so I just held my breath and thought about it for maybe 10, 15 seconds. I&#8217;ve heard from other people that on lookers, I guess the two girls that pulled me out of the water were two of my best friends. They were lifeguards, and one of them said that it looked like my body was shaking in the water like I was trying to flip over and stuff, but I knew.

Call her after I&#8217;m out of surgery &#8217;cause at least she&#8217;ll have some answers then, whether I live or not, really.&#8221; And I didn&#8217;t want her to be stressed through the whole thing, but I knew.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then when I first woke up after surgery, I was super drugged up. They had me on fentanyl three ways, which was awesome. I don&#8217;t recommend it, but I saw some crazy stuff on that fentanyl, and it was still the best I&#8217;ve ever felt on drugs, medication, sorry, on medication. I remember the first time I saw my mom in the hospital, I was just bawling. I had ventilator in. I couldn&#8217;t talk or anything, and I just started crying because it was more like seeing her&#8230; The whole situation obviously was pretty rough, but it was just seeing her face for the first time was pretty hard. But yeah, I never had a moment of, &#8220;Man, I&#8217;m paralyzed. This sucks. I don&#8217;t want to be around anymore.&#8221; It was always just, &#8220;I hate that I have to do this, but sitting here and wallowing isn&#8217;t going to help.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, yeah, sure. There are days when I don&#8217;t really feel like doing anything. Not so much anymore. Not for the last couple of years I don&#8217;t really feel that way. I&#8217;ve more so just wanted to try to do anything possible to make my life better at this point. But at the beginning, there were some ups and downs. There were some really hard things to adjust to. First off, just the first couple months, the amount of pain I was in was really, really hard. I remember screaming at the top of my lungs in the hospital because I thought my legs were on fire, and obviously I can&#8217;t feel anything, but it&#8217;s all nerve pain. And so that was a really hard night. I asked them to give me as much pain meds as possible, but they&#8217;re like, &#8220;You&#8217;ve had as much as you can have, so just deal with it. Go to a happy place,&#8221; sort of thing. So that was a pretty low point.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then every now and again, it&#8217;s hard realizing things that I wanted to do in my life that I won&#8217;t be able to do anymore. I always wanted to be a husband and father, and I just don&#8217;t think that I could do it now as a quadriplegic. Maybe it&#8217;s possible, but I&#8217;m not sure I would ever put someone I love through that, having to take care of me and stuff. Not being able to go out and play sports, I was a huge athlete growing up, so that was pretty hard. Little things too, when I realized I can&#8217;t do them anymore. There&#8217;s something really special about being able to hold a book and smell a book, the feel, the texture, the smell as you turn the pages, I just love it and I can&#8217;t do it anymore, and it&#8217;s little things like that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The two-year mark was pretty rough. Two years is when they say you will get back basically as much as you&#8217;re ever going to get back as far as movement and sensation goes. And so for the first two years, that was the only thing on my mind was try as much as I can to move my fingers, my hands, my feet, everything possible to try to get sensation and movement back. And then when the two-year mark hit, so June 30, 2018, I was really sad that that&#8217;s where I was, and then just randomly here and there, but I was never depressed for long periods of time. Just it never seemed worthwhile to me.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">My faith. My faith in God was a big one. My understanding that it was all for purpose, and even if that purpose wasn&#8217;t anything involving Neuralink, even if that purpose was&#8230; There&#8217;s a story in the Bible about Job, and I think it&#8217;s a really, really popular story about how Job has all of these terrible things happen to him, and he praises God throughout the whole situation. I thought, and I think a lot of people think for most of their lives that they are Job, that they&#8217;re the ones going through something terrible, and they just need to praise God through the whole thing and everything will work out.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">At some point after my accident, I realized that I might not be Job, that I might be one of his children that gets killed or kidnapped or taken from him. And so it&#8217;s about terrible things that happen to those around you who you love. So maybe in this case, my mom would be Job and she has to get through something extraordinarily hard, and I just need to try and make it as best as possible for her because she&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s really going through this massive trial.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; she&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s really going through this massive trial and that gave me a lot of strength, and obviously my family.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ve just always thought I could do anything I ever wanted to do. There was never anything too big. Whatever I set my mind to, I felt like I could do it. I didn&#8217;t want to do a lot. I wanted to travel around and be sort of like a gypsy and go work odd jobs. I had this dream of traveling around Europe and being like, I don&#8217;t know, a shepherd in Wales or Ireland, and then going and being a fisherman in Italy, doing all of these things for a year. It&#8217;s such cliche things, but I just thought it would be so much fun to go and travel and do different things.</span>

And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not how that works.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It works for me. Just don&#8217;t stress and everything will be fine. Everything will work out.&#8221; Obviously not everything always goes well, and it&#8217;s not like it all works out for the best all the time, but I just don&#8217;t think stress has had any place in my life since I was a kid.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">No, no. It was cool. I was never afraid of it. I had to think through a lot. Should I do this? Be the first person? I could wait until number two or three and get a better version of the Neuralink. The first one might not work. Maybe it&#8217;s actually going to kind of suck. It&#8217;s going to be the worst version ever in a person, so why would I do the first one? I&#8217;ve already kind of been selected? I could just tell them, &#8220;Okay, find someone else, and then I&#8217;ll do number two or three.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure they would let me, they&#8217;re looking for a few people anyways, but ultimately I was like, I don&#8217;t know? There&#8217;s something about being the first one to do something. It&#8217;s pretty cool. I always thought that if I had the chance that I would like to do something for the first time, this seemed like a pretty good opportunity. And I was never scared.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think my faith had a huge part in that. I always felt like God was preparing me for something. I almost wish it wasn&#8217;t this, because I had many conversations with God about not wanting to do any of this as a quadriplegic. I told Him, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go out and talk to people. I&#8217;ll go out and travel the world and talk to stadiums, thousands of people, give my testimony. I&#8217;ll do all of it, but heal me first. Don&#8217;t make me do all of this in a chair. That sucks.&#8221; And I guess He won that argument. I didn&#8217;t really have much of a choice. I always felt like there was something going on. And to see how, I guess easily I made it through the interview process and how quickly everything happened, how the stars sort of aligned with all of this. It just told me as the surgery was getting closer, it just told me that it was all meant to happen.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It was all meant to be, and so I shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of anything that&#8217;s to come. And so I wasn&#8217;t. I kept telling myself like, &#8220;You say that now, but as soon as the surgery comes, you&#8217;re probably going to be freaking out. You&#8217;re about to have brain surgery.&#8221; And brain surgery is a big deal for a lot of people, but it&#8217;s an even bigger deal for me. It&#8217;s all I have left. The amount of times I&#8217;ve been like, &#8220;Thank You, God, that you didn&#8217;t take my brain and my personality and my ability to think, my love of learning, my character, everything. Thank You so much. As long as You left me that, then I think I can get by.&#8221; And I was about to let people go root around in there like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re going to go put some stuff in your brain. Hopefully it works out.&#8221; And so it was something that gave me pause, but like I said, how smoothly everything went.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I never expected for a second that anything would go wrong. Plus the more people I met on the Barrow side and on the Neuralink side, they&#8217;re just the most impressive people in the world. I can&#8217;t speak enough to how much I trust these people with my life and how impressed I am with all of them. And to see the excitement on their faces, to walk into a room and, roll into a room and see all of these people looking at me like, &#8220;We&#8217;re so excited. We&#8217;ve been working so hard on this and it&#8217;s finally happening.&#8221; It&#8217;s super infectious and it just makes me want to do it even more.

            <span class="ts-text">No, no. I thought I was going to, but as surgery approached the night before, the morning of, I was just excited. I was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s make this happen.&#8221; I think I said that, something like that to Elon on the phone. Beforehand we were FaceTiming, and I was like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s rock and roll.&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I wasn&#8217;t scared. So we woke up. I think we had to be at the hospital at 5:30 AM. I think surgery was at 7:00 AM So we woke up pretty early. I&#8217;m not sure much of us slept that night. Got to the hospital 5:30, went through all the pre-op stuff. Everyone was super nice. Elon was supposed to be there in the morning, but something went wrong with his plane, so we ended up FaceTiming. That was cool. I had one of the greatest one-liners of my life after that phone call. Hung up with him. There were 20 people around me and I was like, &#8220;I just hope he wasn&#8217;t too starstruck talking to me.&#8221;</span>

I asked God if He would be with my mom in case anything happened to me and just to calm her nerves out there. Woke up, played a bit of a prank on my mom.

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; No, no, not one bit. It was something I had talked about ahead of time with my buddy Bane. I was like, &#8220;I would really like to play a prank on my mom.&#8221; Very specifically, my mom. She&#8217;s very gullible. I think she had knee surgery once even, and after she came out of knee surgery, she was super groggy. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t feel my legs.&#8221; And my dad looked at her. He was like, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have any legs. They had to amputate both your legs.&#8221; And we just do very mean things to her all the time. I&#8217;m so surprised that she still loves us.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But right after surgery, I was really worried that I was going to be too groggy, not all there. I had had anesthesia once before and it messed me up. I could not function for a while afterwards. And I said a lot of things that&#8230; I was really worried that I was going to start, I don&#8217;t know, dropping some bombs and I wouldn&#8217;t even know. I wouldn&#8217;t remember. So I was like, &#8220;Please God, don&#8217;t let that happen, and please let me be there enough to do this to my mom.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so she walked in after surgery. It was the first time they had been able to see me after surgery, and she just looked at me. She said, &#8220;Hi, how are you? How are you doing? How do you feel?&#8221; And I looked at her and this very, I think the anesthesia helped, very groggy, sort of confused look on my face. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; And she just started looking around the room at the surgeons, at the doctors like, &#8220;What did you do to my son? You need to fix this right now.&#8221; Tears started streaming. I saw how much she was freaking out. I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t let this go on.&#8221; And so I was like, &#8220;Mom, mom, I&#8217;m fine. It&#8217;s all right.&#8221; And still, she was not happy about it. She still says she&#8217;s going to get me back someday, but I mean, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s going to look like.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The first little taste I got of it was actually not too long after surgery. Some of the Neuralink team had brought in a little iPad, a little tablet screen, and they had put up eight different channels that were recording some of my neuron spikes and they put it in front of me. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;This is real time your brain firing.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s super cool.&#8221; My first thought was, &#8220;I mean, if they&#8217;re firing now, let&#8217;s see if I can affect them in some way.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So I started trying to wiggle my fingers and I just started scanning through the channels, and one of the things I was doing was moving my index finger up and down, and I just saw this yellow spike on top row, third box over or something. I saw this yellow spike every time I did it, and I was like, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s cool.&#8221; And everyone around me was just like, &#8220;What are you seeing?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Look at this one. Look at this top row, third box over this yellow spike. That&#8217;s me right there, there, there.&#8221; And everyone was freaking out. They started clapping. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s super unnecessary.&#8221; This is what&#8217;s supposed to happen, right?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So you&#8217;re imagining yourself moving each individual finger one at a time, and then seeing that you can notice something. And then when you did the index finger, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, cool.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, I was wiggling all of my fingers to see if anything would happen. There was a lot of other things going on, but that big yellow spike was the one that stood out to me. I&#8217;m sure that if I would&#8217;ve stared at it long enough, I could have mapped out maybe a hundred different things. But the big yellow spike was the one that I noticed.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Maybe you could speak to what it&#8217;s like to wiggle your fingers, to imagine the cognitive effort required to wiggle your index finger, for example. How easy is that to do?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Pretty easy for me. It&#8217;s something that at the very beginning, after my accident, they told me to try and move my body as much as possible. Even if you can&#8217;t, just keep trying because that&#8217;s going to create new neural pathways or pathways in my spinal cord to reconnect these things to hopefully regain some movement someday.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;ll start reconnecting for some people, some people it never works. Some people they&#8217;ll do it. For me, I got some bicep control back, and that&#8217;s about it. If I try enough, I can wiggle some of my fingers, not on command. It&#8217;s more like if I try to move, say my right pinky, and I just keep trying to move it, after a few seconds it&#8217;ll wiggle. So I know there&#8217;s stuff there. I know, and that happens with a few different of my fingers and stuff. But yeah, that&#8217;s what they tell you to do. One of the people at the time when I was in the hospital came in and told me for one guy who had recovered most of his control, what he thought about every day was actually walking, like the act of walking just over and over again. So I tried that for years. I tried just imagining walking, which is, it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard to imagine all of the steps that go into, well, taking a step. All of the things that have to move, all of the activations that have to happen along your leg in order for one step to occur.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I&#8217;m trying. Yeah. So it&#8217;s imagining over again what I had to do to take a step, because it&#8217;s not something any of us think about. We just, you want to walk and you take a step. You don&#8217;t think about all of the different things that are going on in your body. So I had to recreate that in my head as much as I could, and then I practice it over, and over, and over again.</span>

And after a few seconds on screen, she does it. And she did that with every one of her body parts until she can move again. I did that for years, just stared at my body and said, &#8220;Move your index finger, move your big toe.&#8221; Sometimes vocalizing it out loud, sometimes just thinking it. I tried every different way to do this to try to get some movement back. And it&#8217;s hard because it actually is taxing, physically taxing on my body, which is something I would&#8217;ve never expected.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m moving, but it feels like there&#8217;s a buildup of, the only way I can describe it is there are signals that aren&#8217;t getting through from my brain down, because there&#8217;s that gap in my spinal cord, so brain down, and then from my hand back up to the brain. And so it feels like those signals get stuck in whatever body part that I&#8217;m trying to move, and they just build up, and build up, and build up until they burst. And then once they burst, I get this really weird sensation of everything dissipating back out to level, and then I do it again.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s also just a fatigue thing, like a muscle fatigue, but without actually moving your muscles. It&#8217;s very, very bizarre. And then if you try to stare at a body part or think about a body part and move for two, three, four, sometimes eight hours, it&#8217;s very taxing on your mind. It takes a lot of focus. It was a lot easier at the beginning because I wasn&#8217;t able to control a TV in my room or anything. I wasn&#8217;t able to control any of my environment. So for the first few years, a lot of what I was doing was staring at walls. And so, obviously I did a lot of thinking and I tried to move a lot just over, and over, and over again.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But yeah, I was talking about how a lot of what they&#8217;ve had me do, especially at the beginning, well, I still do it now, is body mapping. So there will be a visualization of a hand or an arm on the screen, and I have to do that motion, and that&#8217;s how they train the algorithm to understand what I&#8217;m trying to do. And so it made things very seamless for me I think.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s really, really cool. So it&#8217;s amazing to know. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about the body mapping procedure with the interface and everything like that. It&#8217;s cool to know that you&#8217;ve been essentially training to be world-class at that task.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know if other quadriplegics, other paralyzed people give up. I hope they don&#8217;t. I hope they keep trying, because I&#8217;ve heard other paralyzed people say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever stop.&#8221; They tell you two years, but you just never know. The human body&#8217;s capable of amazing things. So I&#8217;ve heard other people say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up.&#8221; I think one girl had spoken to me through some family members and said that she had been paralyzed for 18 years, and she&#8217;d been trying to wiggle her index finger for all that time, and she finally got it back 18 years later. So I know that it&#8217;s possible, and I&#8217;ll never give up doing it. I do it when I&#8217;m lying down watching TV. I&#8217;ll find myself doing it just almost on its own. It&#8217;s just something I&#8217;ve gotten so used to doing that I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever stop.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s really awesome to hear. I think it&#8217;s one of those things that can really pay off in the long term. It is training. You&#8217;re not visibly seeing the results of that training at the moment, but there&#8217;s that Olympic level nervous system getting ready for something.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Which honestly was something that I think Neuralink gave me that I can&#8217;t thank them enough for. I can&#8217;t show my appreciation for it enough, was being able to visually see that what I&#8217;m doing is actually having some effect. It&#8217;s a huge part of the reason why I know now that I&#8217;m going to keep doing it forever. Because before Neuralink, I was doing it every day and I was just assuming that things were happening. It&#8217;s not like I knew. I wasn&#8217;t getting back any mobility or sensation or anything. So I could have been running up against a brick wall for all I knew. And with Neuralink, I get to see all the signals happening real time, and I get to see that what I&#8217;m doing can actually be mapped. When we started doing click calibrations and stuff, when I go to click my index finger for a left click, that it actually recognizes that. It changed how I think about what&#8217;s possible with retraining my body to move. And so yeah, I&#8217;ll never give up now.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And also just the signal that there&#8217;s still a powerhouse of a brain there that&#8217;s like, and as the technology develops, that brain is, I mean, that&#8217;s the most important thing about the human body is the brain, and it can do a lot of the control. So what did it feel like when you first could wiggle the index finger and saw the environment respond? That little thing, whatever [inaudible 07:22:49] just being way too dramatic according to you?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it was very cool. I mean, it was cool, but I keep telling this to people. It made sense to me. It made sense that there are signals still happening in my brain, and that as long as you had something near it that could measure those, that could record those, then you should be able to visualize it in some way. See it happen. And so that was not very surprising to me. I was just like, &#8220;Oh, cool. We found one, we found something that works.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It was cool to see that their technology worked and that everything that they had worked so hard for was going to pay off. But I hadn&#8217;t moved a cursor or anything at that point. I hadn&#8217;t interacted with a computer or anything at that point. So it just made sense. It was cool. I didn&#8217;t really know much about BCI at that point either, so I didn&#8217;t know what sort of step this was actually making. I didn&#8217;t know if this was a huge deal, or if this was just like, &#8220;Okay, this is, it&#8217;s cool that we got this far, but we&#8217;re actually hoping for something much better down the road.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I just thought that they knew that it turned on.

            <span class="ts-text">I know it must have been within the first maybe week, a week or two weeks that I was able to first move the cursor. And again, it kind of made sense to me. It didn&#8217;t seem like that big of a deal. It was like, okay, well, how do I explain this? When everyone around you starts clapping for something that you&#8217;ve done, it&#8217;s easy to say, &#8220;Okay, I did something cool.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That was impressive in some way. What exactly that meant, what it was hadn&#8217;t really set in for me. So again, I knew that me trying to move a body part and then that being mapped in some sort of machine learning algorithm to be able to identify my brain signals and then take that and give me cursor control, that all kind of made sense to me. I don&#8217;t know all the ins and outs of it, but I was like, &#8220;There are still signals in my brain firing. They just can&#8217;t get through because there&#8217;s a gap in my spinal cord, and so they can&#8217;t get all the way down and back up, but they&#8217;re still there.&#8221; So when I moved the cursor for the first time, I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s cool, but I expected that that should happen.&#8221; It made sense to me. When I moved the cursor for the first time with just my mind, without physically trying to move. So I guess I can get into that just a little bit. The difference between attempted movement, and imagine movement.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, that&#8217;s a fascinating difference [inaudible 07:26:18] from one to the other.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, yeah, yeah. So attempted movement is me physically trying to attempt to move, say my hand. I try to attempt to move my hand to the right, to the left, forward and back. And that&#8217;s all attempted. Attempt to lift my finger up and down, attempt to kick or something. I&#8217;m physically trying to do all of those things, even if you can&#8217;t see it. This would be me attempting to shrug my shoulders or something. That&#8217;s all attempted movement. That&#8217;s what I was doing for the first couple of weeks when they were going to give me cursor control. When I was doing body mapping, it was attempt to do this, attempt to do that. When Nir was telling me to imagine doing it, it kind of made sense to me, but it&#8217;s not something that people practice. If you started school as a child and they said, &#8220;Okay, write your name with this pencil,&#8221; and so you do that. Like, &#8220;Okay, now imagine writing your name with that pencil.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Kids would think, &#8220;Uh, I guess that kind of makes sense,&#8221; and they would do it. But that&#8217;s not something we&#8217;re taught, it&#8217;s all how to do things physically. We think about thought experiments and things, but that&#8217;s not a physical action of doing things. It&#8217;s more what you would do in certain situations. So imagine movement, it never really connected with me. I guess you could maybe describe it as a professional athlete swinging a baseball bat or swinging a golf club. Imagine what you&#8217;re supposed to do. But then you go right to that and physically do it. Then you get a bat in your hand, and then you do what you&#8217;ve been imagining.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so I don&#8217;t have that connection. So telling me to imagine something versus attempting it, there wasn&#8217;t a lot that I could do there mentally. I just kind of had to accept what was going on and try. But the attempted moving thing, it all made sense to me. If I try to move, then there&#8217;s a signal being sent in my brain, and as long as they can pick that up, then they should be able to map it to what I&#8217;m trying to do. And so when I first moved the cursor like that, it was just like, &#8220;Yes, this should happen. I&#8217;m not surprised by that.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Remember there was one Tuesday we were messing around and I think, I forget what swear word you used, but there&#8217;s a swear word that came out of your mouth when you figured out you could just do the direct cursor control.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it blew my mind, no pun intended. Blew my mind when I first moved the cursor just with my thoughts and not attempting to move. It&#8217;s something that I found over the couple of weeks building up to that, that as I get better cursor controls, the model gets better, then it gets easier for me to&#8230; I don&#8217;t have to attempt as much to move it. And part of that is something that I&#8217;d even talked with them about when I was watching the signals of my brain one day. I was watching when I attempted to move to the right and I watched the screen as I saw the spikes. I was seeing the spike, the signal was being sent before I was actually attempting to move. I imagine just because when you go to say, move your hand or any body part, that signal gets sent before you&#8217;re actually moving, has to make it all the way down and back up before you actually do any sort of movement.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So there&#8217;s a delay there. And I noticed that there was something going on in my brain before I was actually attempting to move that my brain was anticipating what I wanted to do, and that all started sort of, I don&#8217;t know, percolating in my brain. It was just there always in the back like, &#8220;That&#8217;s so weird that it could do that. It kind of makes sense, but I wonder what that means as far as using the Neuralink.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then as I was playing around with the attempted movement and playing around with the cursor, and I saw that as the cursor control got better, that it was anticipating my movements and what I wanted it to do, like cursor movements, what I wanted it to do a bit better and a bit better. And then one day I just randomly, as I was playing Webgrid, I looked at a target before I had started attempting to move, I was just trying to get over, train my eyes to start looking ahead, like, &#8220;Okay, this is the target I&#8217;m on, but if I look over here to this target, I know I can maybe be a bit quicker getting there.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I looked over and the cursor just shot over. It was wild. I had to take a step back. I was like, &#8220;This should not be happening.&#8221; All day I was just smiling. I was so giddy. I was like, &#8220;Guys, do you know that this works? I can just think it and it happens.&#8221; Which they&#8217;d all been saying this entire time like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re doing all this with your mind.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, but is it really with my mind. I&#8217;m attempting to move and it&#8217;s just picking that up so it doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s with my mind.&#8221; But when I moved it for the first time like that, it was, oh man. It made me think that this technology, that what I&#8217;m doing is actually way, way more impressive than I ever thought. It was way cooler than I ever thought, and it just opened up a whole new world of possibilities of what could possibly happen with this technology and what I might be able to be capable of with it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s what it felt like.

Like, &#8220;Oh, this works.&#8221; Obviously it works. And so that&#8217;s what I do all the time now. I kind of intermix the attempted movement and imagine movement. I do it all together because I&#8217;ve found that&#8230;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I do it all together because I&#8217;ve found that there is some interplay with it that maximizes efficiency with the cursor. So it&#8217;s not all one or the other. It&#8217;s not all just, I only use attempted or I only use imagined movements. It&#8217;s more I use them in parallel and I can do one or the other. I can just completely think about whatever I&#8217;m doing, but I don&#8217;t know, I like to play around with it. I also like to just experiment with these things. Every now and again, I&#8217;ll get this idea in my head, I wonder if this works and I&#8217;ll just start doing it, and then afterwards I&#8217;ll tell them, &#8220;By the way, I wasn&#8217;t doing that like you guys wanted me to. I thought of something and I wanted to try it and so I did. It seems like it works, so maybe we should explore that a little bit.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So I think that discovery&#8217;s not just for you, at least from my perspective. That&#8217;s a discovery for everyone else who ever uses a Neuralink that this is possible. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an obvious thing that this is even possible. It&#8217;s like I was saying to Bliss earlier, it&#8217;s like the four-minute mile. People thought it was impossible to run a mile in four minutes and once the first person did it, then everyone just started doing it. So just to show that it&#8217;s possible, that paves the way to anyone can now do it. That&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s actually possible. You don&#8217;t need to do the attempted movement, you can just go direct.</span>

So on the Link app there are a few different settings, and different modes, and things I can do on it. So there&#8217;s the body mapping, which we kind of touched on. There&#8217;s a calibration. Calibration is how I actually get cursor control, so calibrating what&#8217;s going on in my brain to translate that into cursor control. So it will pop out models. What they use, I think, is time. So it would be five minutes and calibration will give me so good of a model, and then if I&#8217;m in it for 10 minutes and 15 minutes, the models will progressively get better. And so the longer I&#8217;m in it, generally, the better the models will get.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s really cool because you often refer to the models. So the model&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s constructed once you go through the calibration step.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah, so Snake is kind of like my litmus test for models. If I can control a snake decently well then I know I have a pretty good model. So yeah, the Link app has all of those. It has Webgrid in it now. It&#8217;s also how I connect to the computer just in general. So they&#8217;ve given me a lot of voice controls with it at this point. So I can say, &#8220;Connect,&#8221; or, &#8220;Implant disconnect,&#8221; and as long as I have that charger handy, then I can connect to it. So the charger is also how I connect to the Link app to connect to the computer. I have to have the implant charger over my head when I want to connect, to have it wake up, because the implant&#8217;s in hibernation mode always when I&#8217;m not using it. I think there&#8217;s a setting to wake it up every so long, so we could set it to half an hour, or five hours, or something, if I just want it to wake up periodically.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Open loop is basically I have no control over the cursor. The cursor will be moving on its own across the screen and I am following, by intention, the cursor to different bubbles. And then the algorithm is training off of what the signals it&#8217;s getting are as I&#8217;m doing this. There are a couple of different ways that they&#8217;ve done it. They call it center-out targets. So there will be a bubble in the middle and then eight bubbles around that, and the cursor will go from the middle to one side. So say, middle to left, back to middle, to up, to middle, up, right, and they&#8217;ll do that all the way around the circle. And I will follow that cursor the whole time, and then it will train off of my intentions, what it is expecting my intentions to be throughout the whole process.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, so generally for calibration, I&#8217;m doing attempted movements because I think it works better. I think the better models, as I progress through calibration, make it easier to use imagined movements.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Wait. Wait, wait, wait. So calibrated on attempted movement will create a model that makes it really effective for you to then use the force.</span>

            <span class="ts-name">Noland Arbaugh</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes. I&#8217;ve tried doing calibration with imagined movement and it just doesn&#8217;t work as well for some reason. So that was the center-out targets. There&#8217;s also one where a random target will pop up on the screen and it&#8217;s the same. I just move, I follow along wherever the cursor is, to that target all across the screen. I&#8217;ve tried those with imagined movement and for some reason the models just don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t give as high level as quality when we get into closed loop. I haven&#8217;t played around with it a ton, so maybe the different ways that we&#8217;re doing calibration now might make it a bit better. But what I&#8217;ve found is there will be a point in calibration where I can use imagined movement. Before that point, it doesn&#8217;t really work.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">So if I do calibration for 45 minutes, the first 15 minutes, I can&#8217;t use imagined movement. It just doesn&#8217;t work for some reason. And after a certain point, I can just feel it, I can tell. It moves different. That&#8217;s the best way I can describe it. It&#8217;s almost as if it is anticipating what I am going to do again, before I go to do it. And so using attempted movement for 15 minutes, at some point, I can tell when I move my eyes to the next target that the cursor is starting to pick up. It&#8217;s starting to understand, it&#8217;s learning what I&#8217;m going to do.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So first of all, it&#8217;s really cool that, you are a true pioneer in all of this. You&#8217;re exploring how to do every aspect of this most effectively and there&#8217;s just, I imagine, so many lessons learned from this. So thank you for being a pioneer in all these kinds of different super technical ways. And it&#8217;s also cool to hear that there&#8217;s a different feeling to the experience when it&#8217;s calibrated in different ways because I imagine your brain is doing something different and that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a different feeling to it. And then trying to find the words and the measurements to those feelings would be also interesting. But at the end of the day, you can also measure your actual performance, on whether it&#8217;s Snake or Webgrid, you could see what actually works well. And you&#8217;re saying, for the open loop calibration, the attempted movement works best for now.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">No, no, it makes sense to me. We&#8217;ve done it with a cursor and without a cursor in open loop. So sometimes it&#8217;s just, say for the center out, you&#8217;ll start calibration with a bubble lighting up and I push towards that bubble, and then when it&#8217;s pushed towards that bubble for, say, three seconds, a bubble will pop and then I come back to the middle. So I&#8217;m doing it all just by my intentions. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s learning anyway.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, that&#8217;s one thing that I really, really enjoy about Webgrid is because I&#8217;m so competitive. The higher the BPS, the higher the score, I know the better I&#8217;m doing, and so if I&#8230; I think I&#8217;ve asked at one point, one of the guys, if he could give me some sort of numerical feedback for calibration. I would like to know what they&#8217;re looking at. Like, oh, we see this number while you&#8217;re doing calibration, and that means, at least on our end, that we think calibration is going well. And I would love that because I would like to know if what I&#8217;m doing is going well or not. But then they&#8217;ve also told me, yeah, not necessarily one to one. It doesn&#8217;t actually mean that calibration is going well in some ways. So it&#8217;s not like a hundred percent and they don&#8217;t want to skew what I&#8217;m experiencing or want me to change things based on that, if that number isn&#8217;t always accurate to how the model will turn out or the end result,. That&#8217;s at least what I got from it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">One thing I have asked them, and something that I really enjoy striving for, is towards the end of calibration, there is a time between targets. And so I like to keep, at the end, that number as low as possible. So at the beginning it can be four or five, six seconds between me popping bubbles, but towards the end I like to keep it below 1.5 or if I could get it to one second between bubbles. Because in my mind, that translates really nicely to something like Webgrid, where I know if I can hit a target, one every second, that I&#8217;m doing real, real well.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">There you go. That&#8217;s a way to get a score on the calibrations, like the speed. How quickly can you get from bubble to bubble?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, is that I am closing the loop. So I am actually now the one that is finishing the loop of whatever this loop is. I don&#8217;t even know what the loop is. They&#8217;ve never told me. They just say there is a loop and at one point it&#8217;s open and I can&#8217;t control, and then I get control and it&#8217;s closed. So I&#8217;m finishing the loop.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So how long the calibration usually take? You said 10, 15 minutes, [inaudible 07:48:52]-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, yeah, they&#8217;re trying to get that number down pretty low. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been working on a lot recently, is getting that down is low as possible. So that way, if this is something that people need to do on a daily basis or if some people need to do on a every-other-day basis or once a week, they don&#8217;t want people to be sitting in calibration for long periods of time. I think they&#8217;ve wanted to get it down seven minutes or below, at least where we&#8217;re at right now. It&#8217;d be nice if you never had to do calibration. So we&#8217;ll get there at some point, I&#8217;m sure, the more we learn about the brain, and I think that&#8217;s the dream. I think right now, for me to get really, really good models, I&#8217;m in calibration 40 or 45 minutes. And I don&#8217;t mind, like I said, they always feel really bad, but if it&#8217;s going to get me a model that can break these records on Webgrid, I&#8217;ll stay in it for flipping two hours.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it&#8217;s literally just a grid. They can make it as big or small as you can make a grid. A single box on that grid will light up and you go and click it. And it is a way for them to benchmark how good a BCI is. So it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. You just click targets.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yep. So I like playing on bigger grids because the bigger the grid, the more BPS, it&#8217;s bits per second, that you get every time you click one. So I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;ll play on a 35 by 35 grid, and then one of those little squares, a cell, you can call it, target, whatever, will light up. And you move the cursor there, and you click it, and then you do that forever.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;m at 8.5 right now. I would&#8217;ve beaten that literally the day before I came to Austin. But I had a, I don&#8217;t know, a five-second lag right at the end, and I just had to wait until the latency calmed down, and then I kept clicking. But I was at 8.01, and then five seconds of lag, and then the next three targets I clicked all stayed at 8.01. So if I would&#8217;ve been able to click during that time of lag, I probably would&#8217;ve hit, I don&#8217;t know, I might&#8217;ve hit nine. So I&#8217;m there.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. So I&#8217;ve been playing, first off, with the dwell cursor, which really hampers my Webgrid playing ability. Basically I have to wait 0.3 seconds for every click.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">0.3 seconds, which sucks. It really slows down how high I&#8217;m able to get. I still hit 50, I think I hit 50-something net trials per minute in that, which was pretty good because I&#8217;m able to&#8230; One of the settings is also how slow you need to be moving in order to initiate a click, to start a click. So I can tell, sort of, when I&#8217;m on that threshold, to start initiating a click just a bit early. So I&#8217;m not fully stopped over the target when I go to click, I&#8217;m doing it on my way to the targets a little, to try to time it just right.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, and I&#8217;ve played with that a little bit too. I have to adjust a ton of different parameters in order to play with 0.1, and I don&#8217;t have control over all of that on my end yet. It also changes how the models are trained. If I train a model, like in Webgrid, I bootstrap on a model, which basically is them training models as I&#8217;m playing Webgrid based off of the Webgrid data that I&#8217;m&#8230; So if I play Webgrid for 10 minutes, they can train off that data specifically in order to get me a better model. If I do that with 0.3 versus 0.1, the models come out different. The way that they interact, it&#8217;s just much, much different. So I have to be really careful. I found that doing it with 0.3 is actually better in some ways. Unless I can do it with 0.1 and change all of the different parameters, then that&#8217;s more ideal, because obviously 0.3 is faster than 0.1. So I could get there. I can get there.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">For right now, it&#8217;s the hover clicking with the dwell cursor. Before all the thread retraction stuff happened, we were calibrating clicks, left click, right click. That was my previous ceiling, before I broke the record again with the dwell cursor, was I think on a 35 by 35 grid with left and right click. And you get more BPS, more bits per second, using multiple clicks because it&#8217;s more difficult.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It sucked. It was really, really hard. The day they told me was the day of my big Neuralink tour at their Fremont facility. They told me right before we went over there. It was really hard to hear. My initial reaction was, all right, go in, fix it. Go in, take it out and fix it. The first surgery was so easy. I went to sleep, a couple hours later I woke up and here we are. I didn&#8217;t feel any pain, didn&#8217;t take any pain pills or anything. So I just knew that if they wanted to, they could go in and put in a new one next day if that&#8217;s what it took because I wanted it to be better and I wanted not to lose the capability. I had so much fun playing with it for a few weeks, for a month. It had opened up so many doors for me. It had opened up so many more possibilities that I didn&#8217;t want to lose it after a month.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I thought it would&#8217;ve been a cruel twist of fate if I had gotten to see the view from the top of this mountain and then have it all come crashing down after a month. And I knew, I say the top of the mountain, but how I saw it was I was just now starting to climb the mountain and there was so much more that I knew was possible. And so to have all of that be taken away was really, really hard. But then on the drive over to the facility, I don&#8217;t know, five minute drive, whatever it is, I talked with my parents about it. I prayed about it. I was just like, I&#8217;m not going to let this ruin my day. I&#8217;m not going to let this ruin this amazing tour that they have set up for me. I want to go show everyone how much I appreciate all the work they&#8217;re doing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I want to go meet all of the people who have made this possible, and I want to go have one of the best days of my life, and I did. And it was amazing, and it absolutely was one of the best days I&#8217;ve ever been privileged to experience. And then for a few days I was pretty down in the dumps, but for the first few days afterwards, I didn&#8217;t know if it was ever going to work again. And then I made the decision that, even if I lost the ability to use the Neuralink, even if I lost out on everything to come, if I could keep giving them data in any way, then I would do that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">If I needed to just do some of the data collection every day or body mapping every day for a year, then I would do it because I know that everything I&#8217;m doing helps everyone to come after me, and that&#8217;s all I wanted. Just the whole reason that I did this was to help people, and I knew that anything I could do to help, I would continue to do, even if I never got to use the cursor again, then I was just happy to be a part of it. And everything that I had done was just a perk. It was something that I got to experience, and I know how amazing it&#8217;s going to be for everyone to come after me. So might as well just keep trucking along.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So when they did that, it was like a light over the head, light bulb moment, like, oh, this works and this seems like we can run with this. And I saw the uptick in performance immediately. I could feel it when they switched over. I was like, &#8220;This is better. This is good. Everything up until this point,&#8221; for the last few weeks, last, whatever, three or four weeks because it was before they even told me, &#8220;Everything before this sucked. Let&#8217;s keep doing what we&#8217;re doing now.&#8221; And at that point it was not like, oh, I know I&#8217;m still only at, say in Webgrid terms, four or five BPS compared to my 7.5 before, but I know that if we keep doing this, then I can get back there. And then they gave me the dwell cursor and the dwell cursor sucked at first. It&#8217;s obviously not what I want, but it gave me a path forward to be able to continue using it and hopefully to continue to help out. And so I just ran with it, never looked back. Like I said, I&#8217;m just kind of person, I roll with the punches anyway. So-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">What was the process? What was the feedback loop on the figuring out how to do the spike detection in a way that would actually work well for Noland?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question. So maybe just to describe first how the actual update worked. It was basically an update to your implant. So we just did an over-the-air software update to his implants, same way you&#8217;d update your Tesla or your iPhone. And that firmware change enabled us to record averages of populations of neurons nearby individual electrodes. So we have less resolution about which individual neuron is doing what, but we have a broader picture of what&#8217;s going on nearby an electrode overall. And that feedback loop, basically as Noland described it, it was immediate when we flipped that switch. I think the first day we did that, you had three or four BPS right out of the box, and that was a light bulb moment for, okay, this is the right path to go down. And from there, there&#8217;s a lot of feedback around how to make this useful for independent use.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So what we care about ultimately is that you can use it independently to do whatever you want. And to get to that point, it required us to re-engineer the UX, as you talked about with the dwell cursor, to make it something that you can use independently without us needing to be involved all the time. And yeah, this is obviously the start of this journey still. Hopefully we get back to the places where you&#8217;re doing multiple clicks and using that to control, much more fluidly, everything, and much more naturally the applications that you&#8217;re trying to interface with.</span>

I need this.&#8221; I think a lot of it just doesn&#8217;t occur to them maybe, until someone is actually using the app, using the implant. It&#8217;s just something that they just never would&#8217;ve thought of or it&#8217;s very specific to even me, maybe what I want. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m a little worried about with the next people that come is maybe they will want things much different than how I&#8217;ve set it up or what the advice I&#8217;ve given the team, and they&#8217;re going to look at some of the things they&#8217;ve added for me. [inaudible 08:07:26] like, &#8220;That&#8217;s a dumb idea.

And then they&#8217;re also going to give me some pushback about, yeah, what you are asking them to do here, that&#8217;s a bad idea. Let&#8217;s do it this way. And I&#8217;m more than happy to have that happen, but it&#8217;s just a lot of different interactions with different games or applications, the internet, just with the computer in general. There&#8217;s tons of bugs that end up popping up, left, right, center.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So it&#8217;s just me trying to use it as much as possible and showing them what works and what doesn&#8217;t work, and what I would like to be better. And then they take that feedback and they usually create amazing things for me. They solve these problems in ways I would&#8217;ve never imagined. They&#8217;re so good at everything they do, and so I&#8217;m just really thankful that I&#8217;m able to give them feedback and they can make something of it, because a lot of my feedback is really dumb. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;I want this, please do something about it,&#8221; and it&#8217;ll come back, super well-thought-out, and it&#8217;s way better than anything I could have ever thought of or implemented myself.

The more load that I can take away from people around me, the better. If I&#8217;m able to interact with the world without using my family, without going through any of my friends, needing them to help me with things, the better. If I&#8217;m able to sit up on my computer all night and not need someone to sit me up, say, on my iPad, in a position where I can use it, and then have to have them wait up for me all night until I&#8217;m ready to be done using it, it takes a load off of all of us and it&#8217;s really all I can ask for. It&#8217;s something that I could never thank Neuralink enough for, and I know my family feels the same way. Just being able to have the freedom to do things on my own at any hour of the day or night, it means the world to me and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Generally, it is me playing music of some sort. I have a massive playlist, and so I&#8217;m just rocking out to music. And then it&#8217;s also just a race against time, because I&#8217;m constantly looking at how much battery percentage I have left on my implant, like, &#8220;All right. I have 30%, which equates to X amount of time, which means I have to break this record in the next hour and a half or else it&#8217;s not happening tonight.&#8221; And so it&#8217;s a little stressful when that happens. When it&#8217;s above 50%, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, I got time.&#8221; It starts getting down to 30, and then 20 it&#8217;s like, &#8220;All right, 10%, a little popup is going to pop up right here, and it&#8217;s going to really screw my Webgrid flow. It&#8217;s going to tell me that&#8230; The low battery popup comes up and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It&#8217;s really going to screw me over. So if I&#8217;m going to break this record, I have to do it in the next 30 seconds,&#8221; or else that popup is going to get in the way, cover my Webgrid.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then after that, I go click on it, go back into Webgrid, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;All right, that means I have 10 minutes left before this thing&#8217;s dead.&#8221; That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on in my head, generally. That and whatever song&#8217;s playing. And I want to break those records so bad. It&#8217;s all I want when I&#8217;m playing Webgrid. It has become less of like, &#8220;Oh, this is just a leisurely activity. I just enjoy doing this because it just feels so nice and it puts me at ease.&#8221; It is, &#8220;No. Once I&#8217;m in Webgrid, you better break this record or you&#8217;re going to waste five hours of your life right now.&#8221; And I don&#8217;t know.

            <span class="ts-text">I do. Yeah. So the great part about Korea is they focus on science tech victories, which was not planned. I&#8217;ve been playing Korea for years, and then all of the [inaudible 08:16:23] stuff happened, so it aligns. But what I&#8217;ve noticed with tech victories is if you can just rush tech, rush science, then you can do anything. At one point in the game, you&#8217;ll be so far ahead of everyone technologically that you&#8217;ll have musket men, infantrymen, planes sometimes, and people will still be fighting with bows and arrows. And so if you want to win a domination victory, you just get to a certain point with the science, and then go and wipe out the rest of the world. Or you can just take science all the way and win that way, and you&#8217;re going to be so far ahead of everyone because you&#8217;re producing so much science that it&#8217;s not even close. I&#8217;ve accidentally won in different ways just by focusing on science.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I was playing only science, obviously. Just science all the way, just tech. And I was trying to get every tech in the tech tree and stuff, and then I accidentally won through a diplomatic victory, and I was so mad. I was so mad because it just ends the game one turn. It was like, &#8220;Oh, you won. You&#8217;re so diplomatic.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this. I should have declared war on more people or something.&#8221; It was terrible. But you don&#8217;t need giant civilizations with tech, especially with Korea. You can keep it pretty small. So I generally just get to a certain military unit and put them all around my border to keep everyone out, and then I will just build up. So very isolationist.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there&#8217;s a virtual keyboard. That&#8217;s another thing I would like to work more on is finding some way to type or text in a different way. Right now, it is a dictation basically and a virtual keyboard that I can use with the cursor, but we&#8217;ve played around with finger spelling, sign language finger spelling, and that seems really promising. So I have this thought in my head that it&#8217;s going to be a very similar learning curve that I had with the cursor where I went from attempted movement to imagine movement at one point. I have a feeling, this is just my intuition, that at some point, I&#8217;m going to be doing finger spelling and I won&#8217;t need to actually attempt to finger spell anymore, that I&#8217;ll just be able to think the letter that I want and it&#8217;ll pop up.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That would be epic. That&#8217;s challenging. That&#8217;s hard. That&#8217;s a lot of work for you to take that leap, but that would be awesome.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then going from letters to words is another step. Right now, it&#8217;s finger spelling of just the sign language alphabet, but if it&#8217;s able to pick that up, then it should be able to pick up the whole sign language language, and so then if I could do something along those lines, or just the sign language spelled word, if I can spell it at a reasonable speed and it can pick that up, then I would just be able to think that through and it would do the same thing. After what I saw with the cursor control, I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t work, but we&#8217;d have to play around with it more.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s very, very cool about this. I mean, we&#8217;re talking about the brain, so this is just motor cortex stuff. There&#8217;s so much more that can be done. The vision one is fascinating to me. I think that is going to be very, very cool. To give someone the ability to see for the first time in their life would just be&#8230; I mean, it might be more amazing than even helping someone like me. That just sounds incredible. The speech thing is really interesting. Being able to have some real-time translation and cut away that language barrier would be really cool. Any actual impairments that it could solve with speech would be very, very cool.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then also, there are a lot of different disabilities that all originate in the brain, and you would be able to hopefully be able to solve a lot of those. I know there&#8217;s already stuff to help people with seizures that can be implanted in the brain. I imagine the same thing. And so you could do something like that. I know that even someone like Joe Rogan has talked about the possibilities with being able to stimulate the brain in different ways. I&#8217;m not sure how ethical a lot of that would be. That&#8217;s beyond me, honestly. But I know that there is a lot that can be done when we&#8217;re talking about the brain and being able to go in and physically make changes to help people or to improve their lives. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to everything that comes from this. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s all that far off.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, flip a switch like that, make someone happy. I think Joe has talked about it more in terms of you want to experience what a drug trip feels like. You want to experience what it&#8217;d be like to be on mushrooms or something like that, DMT. You can just flip that switch in the brain. My buddy, Bain, has talked about being able to wipe parts of your memory and re-experience things for the first time, like your favorite movie or your favorite book, just wipe that out real quick, and then re-fall in love with Harry Potter or something. I told him, I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I feel about people being able to just wipe parts of your memory.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Oh, 100%. I know another thing with being able to give people the ability to feel sensation and stuff too, by going in with the brain and having a Neuralink maybe do that, that could be something that could be transferred through the Optimus as well. There&#8217;s all sorts of really cool interplay between that. And then also, like you said, just physically interacting. I mean, 99% of the things that I can&#8217;t do myself, obviously, I need a caretaker for, someone to physically do things for me. If an Optimus robot could do that, I could live an incredibly independent life and not be such a burden on those around me, and it would change the way people like me live, at least until whatever this is gets cured.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But being able to interact with the world physically, that would just be amazing. And not just for having it be a caretaker or something, but something like I talked about. Just being able to read a book. Imagine an Optimus robot just being able to hold a book open in front of me. I get that smell again. I might not be able to feel it at that point, or maybe I could, again, with the sensation and stuff. But there&#8217;s something different about reading a physical book than staring at a screen or listening to an audiobook. I actually don&#8217;t like audiobooks. I&#8217;ve listened to a ton of them at this point, but I don&#8217;t really like them. I would much rather read a physical copy.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. Oh, man. The touch, the smell. I mean, it&#8217;s just something about the words on the page. And they&#8217;ve replicated that page color on the Kindle and stuff. Yeah, it&#8217;s just not the same. Yeah. So just something as simple as that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I do. Yeah. A lot of things that I interact with in the world, like clothes or literally any physical thing that I interact within the world, a lot of times what people around me will do is they&#8217;ll just come rub it on my face. They&#8217;ll lay something on me so I can feel the weight. They will rub a shirt on me so I can feel fabric. There&#8217;s something very profound about touch, and it&#8217;s something that I miss a lot and something I would love to do again. We&#8217;ll see.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I know. It&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;ve asked God for basically every day since my accident was just being able to one day move, even if it was only my hand, so that way, I could squeeze my mom&#8217;s hand or something just to show her how much I care and how much I love her and everything. Something along those lines. Being able to just interact with the people around me. Handshake, give someone a hug. I don&#8217;t know. Anything like that. Being able to help me eat.

            <span class="ts-text">Oh, man. I think it&#8217;s all about understanding how much we need God. And I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s any light without the dark. I think that if all of us were happy all the time, there would be no reason to turn to God ever. I feel like there would be no concept of good or bad, and I think that as much of the darkness and the evil that&#8217;s in the world, it makes us all appreciate the good and the things we have so much more. And I think when I had my accident, one of the first things I said to one of my best friends was&#8230; And this was within the first month or two after my accident, I said, &#8220;Everything about this accident has just made me understand and believe that God is real and that there really is a God, basically. And that my interactions with him have all been real and worthwhile.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And he said, if anything, seeing me go through this accident, he believes that there isn&#8217;t a God. And it&#8217;s a very different reaction, but I believe that it is a way for God to test us, to build our character, to send us through trials and tribulations, to make sure that we understand how precious He is and the things that He&#8217;s given us and the time that He&#8217;s given us, and then to hopefully grow from all of that. I think that&#8217;s a huge part of being here, is to not just have an easy life and do everything that&#8217;s easy, but to step out of our comfort zones and really challenge ourselves because I think that&#8217;s how we grow.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Oh, man. I think people are my biggest inspiration. Even just being at Neuralink for a few months, looking people in the eyes and hearing their motivations for why they&#8217;re doing this, it&#8217;s so inspiring. And I know that they could be other places, at cushier jobs, working somewhere else, doing X, Y, or Z, that doesn&#8217;t really mean that much. But instead, they&#8217;re here and they want to better humanity, and they want to better just the people around them. The people that they&#8217;ve interacted with in their life, they want to make better lives for their own family members who might have disabilities, or they look at someone like me and they say, &#8220;I can do something about that. So I&#8217;m going to.&#8221; And it&#8217;s always been what I&#8217;ve connected with most in the world are people.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I&#8217;ve always been a people person and I love learning about people, and I love learning how people developed and where they came from, and to see how much people are willing to do for someone like me when they don&#8217;t have to, and they&#8217;re going out of their way to make my life better. It gives me a lot of hope for just humanity in general, how much we care and how much we&#8217;re capable of when we all get together and try to make a difference. And I know there&#8217;s a lot of bad out there in the world, but there always has been and there always will be. And I think that that is&#8230; It shows human resiliency and it shows what we&#8217;re able to endure and how much we just want to be there and help each other, and how much satisfaction we get from that, because I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons that we&#8217;re here is just to help each other, and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. That always gives me hope, is just realizing that there are people out there who still care and who want to help.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nolan Arbaugh, and before that, with Elon Musk, DJ Seo, Matthew McDougall, and Bliss Chapman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Aldous Huxley in The Doors of Perception. &#8220;We live together. We act on and react to one another. But always, and in all circumstances, we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena. They are crucified alone. Embrace the lovers desperately tried to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence in vain. But it&#8217;s very nature, every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy its solitude, sensations, feelings, insights, fancies, all these are private, and except through symbols and a secondhand incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.&#8221; Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</span>
