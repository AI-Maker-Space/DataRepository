    (a) In General.--
            (1) Prohibition of foreign adversary controlled 
        applications.--It shall be unlawful for an entity to 
        distribute, maintain, or update (or enable the distribution, 
        maintenance, or updating of) a foreign adversary controlled 
        application by carrying out, within the land or maritime 
        borders of the United States, any of the following:
                    (A) Providing services to distribute, maintain, or 
                update such foreign adversary controlled application 
                (including any source code of such application) by 
                means of a marketplace (including an online mobile 
                application store) through which users within the land 
                or maritime borders of the United States may access, 
                maintain, or update such application.
                    (B) Providing internet hosting services to enable 
                the distribution, maintenance, or updating of such 
                foreign adversary controlled application for users 
                within the land or maritime borders of the United 
                States.
            (2) Applicability.--Subsection (a) shall apply--
                    (A) in the case of an application that satisfies 
                the definition of a foreign adversary controlled 
                application pursuant to subsection (g)(3)(A), beginning 
                on the date that is 180 days after the date of the 
                enactment of this Act; and
                    (B) in the case of an application that satisfies 
                the definition of a foreign adversary controlled 
                application pursuant to subsection (g)(3)(B), beginning 
                on the date that is 180 days after the date of the 
                relevant determination of the President under such 
                subsection.
    (b) Data and Information Portability to Alternative Applications.--
Before the date on which a prohibition under subsection (a) applies to 
a foreign adversary controlled application, the entity that owns or 
controls such application shall provide, upon request by a user of such 
application within the land or maritime borders of United States, to 
such user all the available data related to the account of such user 
with respect to such application. Such data shall be provided in a 
machine readable format and shall include any data maintained by such 
application with respect to the account of such user, including content 
(including posts, photos, and videos) and all other account 
information.
    (c) Exemptions.--
            (1) Exemptions for qualified divestitures.--Subsection 
        (a)--
                    (A) does not apply to a foreign adversary 
                controlled application with respect to which a 
                qualified divestiture is executed before the date on 
                which a prohibition under subsection (a) would begin to 
                apply to such application; and
                    (B) shall cease to apply in the case of a foreign 
                adversary controlled application with respect to which 
                a qualified divestiture is executed after the date on 
                which a prohibition under subsection (a) applies to 
                such application.
            (2) Exemptions for certain necessary services.--Subsections 
        (a) and (b) do not apply to services provided with respect to a

        an entity to attain compliance with such subsections.
    (d) Enforcement.--
            (1) Civil penalties.--
                    (A) Foreign adversary controlled application 
                violations.--An entity that violates subsection (a) 
                shall be subject to pay a civil penalty in an amount 
                not to exceed the amount that results from multiplying 
                $5,000 by the number of users within the land or 
                maritime borders of the United States determined to 
                have accessed, maintained, or updated a foreign 
                adversary controlled application as a result of such 
                violation.
                    (B) Data and information violations.--An entity 
                that violates subsection (b) shall be subject to pay a 
                civil penalty in an amount not to exceed the amount 
                that results from multiplying $500 by the number of 
                users within the land or maritime borders of the United 
                States affected by such violation.
            (2) Actions by attorney general.--The Attorney General--
                    (A) shall conduct investigations related to 
                potential violations of subsection (a) or (b), and, if 
                such an investigation results in a determination that a 
                violation has occurred, the Attorney General shall 
                pursue enforcement under paragraph (1); and
                    (B) may bring an action in an appropriate district 
                court of the United States for appropriate relief, 
                including civil penalties under paragraph (1) or 
                declaratory and injunctive relief.
    (e) Severability.--
            (1) In general.--If any provision of this section or the 
        application of this section to any person or circumstance is 
        held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect the other 
        provisions or applications of this section that can be given 
        effect without the invalid provision or application.
            (2) Subsequent determinations.--If the application of any 
        provision of this section is held invalid with respect to a 
        foreign adversary controlled application that satisfies the 
        definition of such term pursuant to subsection (g)(3)(A), such 
        invalidity shall not affect or preclude the application of the 
        same provision of this section to such foreign adversary 
        controlled application by means of a subsequent determination 
        pursuant to subsection (g)(3)(B).
    (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed--
            (1) to authorize the Attorney General to pursue 
        enforcement, under this section, other than enforcement of 
        subsection (a) or (b);
            (2) to authorize the Attorney General to pursue 
        enforcement, under this section, against an individual user of 
        a foreign adversary controlled application; or
            (3) except as expressly provided herein, to alter or affect 
        any other authority provided by or established under another 
        provision of Federal law.
