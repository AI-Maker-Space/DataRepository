He\nhad lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London\nbecause it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark\nhaired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him\nmost was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so\nworried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends\nwas a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of\nhis friends worked in advertising.\nIt hadn\u2019t properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock\ndown his house and build an bypass instead.\nAt eight o\u2019clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn\u2019t feel very good.

In other words he was a\ncarbon-based life form descended from an ape. More speci\ufb01cally he was forty,\nfat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though\nhe didn\u2019t know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan,\nthough intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that\nhe had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in\nMr. L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the\ntum and a predilection for little fur hats.\nHe was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man.\nToday he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone\nseriously wrong with his job - which was to see that Arthur Dent\u2019s house got\ncleared out of the way before the day was out.\n- Come o\ufb00 it, Mr. Dent, - he said, - you can\u2019t win you know. You can\u2019t lie\nin front of the bulldozer inde\ufb01nitely. - He tried to make his eyes blaze \ufb01ercely\nbut they just wouldn\u2019t do it.\nArthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.\n- I\u2019m game, - he said, - we\u2019ll see who rusts \ufb01rst.\n- I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to accept it, - said Mr. Prosser gripping\nhis fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, - this bypass has got to be\nbuilt and it\u2019s going to be built!\n- First I\u2019ve heard of it, - said Arthur, - why\u2019s it going to be built?\nMr. Prosser shook his \ufb01nger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away\nagain.\n- What do you mean, why\u2019s it got to be built? - he said. - It\u2019s a bypass.\nYou\u2019ve got to build bypasses.\nBypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point\nB very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People\nliving at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder\nwhat\u2019s so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to\nget there, and what\u2019s so great about point B that so many people of point A\nare so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for\nall work out where the hell they wanted to be.\nMr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn\u2019t anywhere in particular,\nit was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He\nwould have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend\na pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point\nD.

The \ufb01rst I knew\nabout it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he\u2019d\ncome to clean the windows and he said no he\u2019d come to demolish the house.\nHe didn\u2019t tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of\nwindows and charged me a \ufb01ver. Then he told me.\n- But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning o\ufb03ce\nfor the last nine month.\n- Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday\nafternoon. You hadn\u2019t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them\nhad you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.\n- But the plans were on display...\n- On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to \ufb01nd them.\n- That\u2019s the display department.\n- With a torch.\n- Ah, well the lights had probably gone.\n- So had the stairs.\n- But look, you found the notice didn\u2019t you?\n- Yes, - said Arthur, - yes I did.

It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay\npropped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent\u2019s\nhouse. Mr. Prosser frowned at it.\n- It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a particularly nice house, - he said.\n- I\u2019m sorry, but I happen to like it.\n- You\u2019ll like the bypass.\n- Oh shut up, - said Arthur Dent. - Shut up and go away, and take your\nbloody bypass with you. You haven\u2019t got a leg to stand on and you know it.\nMr. Prosser\u2019s mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was\nfor a moment \ufb01lled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur\nDent\u2019s house being consumed with \ufb01re and Arthur himself running screaming\nfrom the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.\nMr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel\nvery nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.\n- Mr. Dent, - he said.\n- Hello? Yes? - said Arthur.\n- Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage\nthat bulldozer would su\ufb00er if I just let it roll straight over you?\n- How much? - said Arthur.\n- None at all, - said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously o\ufb00 wondering why\nhis brain was \ufb01lled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.", "27852b5b-9401-4772-98d7-612547b5854b": "12 CHAPTER 1.\nBy a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-\ndescendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended\nfrom an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse\nand not from Guildford as he usually claimed.\nArthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.\nThis friend of his had \ufb01rst arrived on the planet some \ufb01fteen Earth years\npreviously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society - with,\nit must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those \ufb01fteen years\npretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.\nHe had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit\non his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to\nchoose the name \u201dFord Prefect\u201d as being nicely inconspicuous.\nHe was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicu-\nously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from\nthe temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There\nwas something very slightly odd about him, but it was di\ufb03cult to say what\nit was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn\u2019t blink often enough and when you\ntalked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on\nhis behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people\nthe unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.\nHe struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but\na harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he\nwould often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun\nof any astrophysicist he could \ufb01nd till he got thrown out.\nSometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into\nthe sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he\nwould start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.\n- Oh, just looking for \ufb02ying saucers, - he would joke and everyone would\nlaugh and ask him what sort of \ufb02ying saucers he was looking for.\n- Green ones! - he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment\nand then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of\ndrinks.\nEvenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on\nwhisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases\nthat honestly the colour of the \ufb02ying saucers didn\u2019t matter that much really.\nThereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often\nask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would\nusually say something like:\n- Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you went o\ufb00 home sir?\n- I\u2019m trying to baby, I\u2019m trying to, - is what Ford invariably replied on these\noccasions.\nIn fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into\nthe night sky was any kind of \ufb02ying saucer at all. The reason he said green was\nthat green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.\nFord Prefect was desperate that any \ufb02ying saucer at all would arrive soon\nbecause \ufb01fteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly\nsomewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.\nFord wished that a \ufb02ying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how\nto \ufb02ag \ufb02ying saucers down and get lifts from them.

It was Arthur\u2019s accepted role\nto lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his\nmother or a good book; it was Mr. Prosser\u2019s accepted role to tackle Arthur\nwith the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March\nof Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never\nLooked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bull-\ndozer drivers accepted role to sit around drinking co\ufb00ee and experimenting with\nunion regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their \ufb01nancial ad-\nvantage.\nThe Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.\nThe sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.\nA shadow moved across him again.\n- Hello Arthur, - said the shadow.\nArthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect\nstanding above him.\n- Ford!

He said,\n- Good, is there anywhere we can talk?\n- What? - said Arthur Dent.\nFor a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared \ufb01xedly into the sky\nlike a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down\nbeside Arthur.\n- We\u2019ve got to talk, - he said urgently.\n- Fine, - said Arthur, - talk.\n- And drink, - said Ford. - It\u2019s vitally important that we talk and drink.\nNow. We\u2019ll go to the pub in the village.\nHe looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.\n- Look, don\u2019t you understand? - shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. -\nThat man wants to knock my house down!\nFord glanced at him, puzzled.\n- Well he can do it while you\u2019re away can\u2019t he? - he asked.\n- But I don\u2019t want him to!\n- Ah.\n- Look, what\u2019s the matter with you Ford? - said Arthur.\n- Nothing. Nothing\u2019s the matter. Listen to me - I\u2019ve got to tell you the most\nimportant thing you\u2019ve ever heard. I\u2019ve got to tell you now, and I\u2019ve got to tell\nyou in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.\n- But why?\n- Because you are going to need a very sti\ufb00 drink.\nFord stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to \ufb01nd that his will was\nbeginning to weaken.

They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the\nstar Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.\nThe planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence,\nwhich was just how they wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings\nwent unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip,\nWoomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them - which was a pity\nbecause it was exactly the sort of thing they\u2019d been looking for all these years.\nThe only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a\nSub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the\ndarkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his\nneck. The contents of Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were quite interesting in fact and\nwould have made any Earth physicist\u2019s eyes pop out of his head, which is why\nhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays\nhe pretended he was auditioning for stu\ufb00ed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha\nSens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb - a short squat black\nrod, smooth and matt with a couple of \ufb02at switches and dials at one end; he also\nhad a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator. This had\nabout a hundred tiny \ufb02at press buttons and a screen about four inches square\non which any one of a million \u201dpages\u201d could be summoned at a moment\u2019s notice.\nIt looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug\nplastic cover it \ufb01tted into had the words Don\u2019t Panic printed on it in large\nfriendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most\nremarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations\nof Ursa Minor - The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it\nwas published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if\nit were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require\nseveral inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.\nBeneath that in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a\nlargish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.\nThe Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject\nof towels.\nA towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch\nhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - you can wrap it around you\nfor warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on\n21", "1eedcab7-ad79-416e-bc4f-c6a9171e8b33": "22 CHAPTER 3.\nit on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady\nsea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on\nthe desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy\nriver Moth; wet it for use in hand-tohand-combat; wrap it round your head to\nward o\ufb00 noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast\nof Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can\u2019t see it, it\ncan\u2019t see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in\nemergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself o\ufb00 with it if it still\nseems to be clean enough.\nMore importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some rea-\nson, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel\nwith him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a tooth-\nbrush, face \ufb02annel, soap, tin of biscuits, \ufb02ask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat\nspray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then\nhappily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch\nhiker might accidentally have \u201dlost\u201d. What the strag will think is that any man\nwho can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle\nagainst terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly\na man to be reckoned with.\nHence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in\n- Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There\u2019s a frood who really knows\nwhere his towel is.\n(Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy;\nfrood: really amazingly together guy.)\nNestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel, the Sub-Etha\nSens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet\nthe huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided\nit was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.\n- You got a towel with you? - said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.\nArthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.\n- Why? What, no... should I have? - He had given up being surprised, there\ndidn\u2019t seem to be any point any longer.\nFord clicked his tongue in irritation.\n- Drink up, - he urged.\nAt that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside \ufb01ltered\nthrough the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through\nthe sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had even-\ntually bought him.\nArthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.\n- What\u2019s that? - he yelped.\n- Don\u2019t worry, - said Ford, - they haven\u2019t started yet.\n- Thank God for that, - said Arthur and relaxed.\n- It\u2019s probably just your house being knocked down, - said Ford, drowning\nhis last pint.\n- What? - shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford\u2019s spell was broken. Arthur looked\nwildly around him and ran to the window.\n- My God they are! They\u2019re knocking my house down. What the hell am I\ndoing in the pub, Ford?\n- It hardly makes any di\ufb00erence at this stage, - said Ford, - let them have\ntheir fun.", "478ad7d5-7589-4c28-bad5-cdae1f49df08": "23\n- Fun? - yelped Arthur. - Fun! - He quickly checked out of the window again\nthat they were talking about the same thing.\n- Damn their fun! - he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a\nnearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.\n- Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers! - bawled Arthur. - You half crazed\nVisigoths, stop will you!\nFord would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he asked\nfor four packets of peanuts.\n- There you are sir, - said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, -\ntwenty-eight pence if you\u2019d be so kind.\nFord was very kind - he gave the barman another \ufb01ve-pound note and told\nhim to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford.\nHe suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn\u2019t\nunderstand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments\nof great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This\nsignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that\nbeing is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be further\nthan sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn\u2019t very far,\nso such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment\nunder great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of\nBetelgeuse.\nThe barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense\nof distance. He didn\u2019t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with\na new sense of respect, almost awe.\n- Are you serious, sir? - he said in a small whisper which had the e\ufb00ect of\nsilencing the pub. - You think the world\u2019s going to end?\n- Yes, - said Ford.\n- But, this afternoon?\nFord had recovered himself. He was at his \ufb02ippest.\n- Yes, - he said gaily, - in less than two minutes I would estimate.\nThe barman couldn\u2019t believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn\u2019t\nbelieve the sensation he had just had either.\n- Isn\u2019t there anything we can do about it then? - he said.\n- No, nothing, - said Ford, stu\ufb03ng the peanuts into his pockets.\nSomeone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid ev-\neryone had become.\nThe man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes waved their\nway up to Ford.\n- I thought, - he said, - that if the world was going to end we were meant to\nlie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.\n- If you like, yes, - said Ford.\n- That\u2019s what they told us in the army, - said the man, and his eyes began\nthe long trek back down to his whisky.\n- Will that help? - asked the barman.\n- No, - said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. - Excuse me, - he said, -\nI\u2019ve got to go. - With a wave, he left.\nThe pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough,\nthe man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along\nto the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so,\nand it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a", "823dc829-03aa-41f3-9ddc-3f5c7d43abd9": "24 CHAPTER 3.\nminute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whi\ufb00 of hydrogen,\nozone and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be\ntoo busy evaporating herself to notice it.\nThe barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say:\n- Last orders, please.\nThe huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster.\nFord knew they were there. This wasn\u2019t the way he had wanted it.\nRunning up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn\u2019t notice\nhow cold it had suddenly become, he didn\u2019t notice the wind, he didn\u2019t notice the\nsudden irrational squall of rain. He didn\u2019t notice anything but the caterpillar\nbulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home.\n- You barbarians! - he yelled. - I\u2019ll sue the council for every penny it\u2019s got!\nI\u2019ll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And boiled... until...\nuntil... until you\u2019ve had enough.\nFord was running after him very fast. Very very fast.\n- And then I\u2019ll do it again! - yelled Arthur. - And when I\u2019ve \ufb01nished I will\ntake all the little bits, and I will jump on them!\nArthur didn\u2019t notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he\ndidn\u2019t notice that Mr. Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. What Mr.\nProsser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through\nthe clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings.\n- And I will carry on jumping on them, - yelled Arthur, still running, - until\nI get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then...\nArthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed \ufb02at on his back. At last\nhe noticed that something was going on. His \ufb01nger shot upwards.\n- What the hell\u2019s that? - he shrieked.\nWhatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky\napart with mind-buggering noise and leapt o\ufb00 into the distance leaving the\ngaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your\nskull.\nAnother one followed and did the same thing only louder.\nIt\u2019s di\ufb03cult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were\ndoing now, because they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing themselves.\nNone of it made a lot of sense - running into houses, running out of houses,\nhowling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded\nwith people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then\nrolled o\ufb00 like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to\n\ufb02atten everything it hit.\nOnly one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in\nhis eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly what was happening\nand had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-OMatic had started winking in\nthe dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start. It was what he\nhad waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern\nsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed\nhis heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a\nbig hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn\u2019t it just have to be the Vogons.\nStill he knew what he had to do.

For\na while nothing happened.\nThe great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth.\nMotionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against\nnature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass\nwhat they were looking at. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way\nthat bricks don\u2019t.\nAnd still nothing happened.\nThen there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient\nsound. Every hi \ufb01 set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette\nrecorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly\nturned itself on.\nEvery tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass,\nevery sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding\nboard.\nBefore the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate\nin sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built. But there\nwas no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message.\n- People of Earth, your attention please, - a voice said, and it was wonderful.\nWonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make\na brave man weep.\n- This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Coun-\ncil, - the voice continued. - As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for\ndevelopment of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hy-\nperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet\nis one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that\ntwo of your Earth minutes. Thank you.\nThe PA died away.\nUncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. The terror\nmoved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron \ufb01llings on a\nsheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them. Panic sprouted again,\ndesperate \ufb02eeing panic, but there was nowhere to \ufb02ee to.\nObserving this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said:\n- There\u2019s no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts\nand demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department\non Alpha Centauri for \ufb01fty of your Earth years, so you\u2019ve had plenty of time to\nlodge any formal complaint and it\u2019s far too late to start making a fuss about it\nnow.\nThe PA fell silent again and its echo drifted o\ufb00 across the land. The huge\nships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the underside of each a\nhatchway opened, an empty black space.\nBy this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter,\nlocated a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to\nplead on behalf of the planet.

It would be some time before it reached\nits destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It\nconsists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty\nbut annoyingly wide stretches of ocean.\nThe boat sped on.\nBecause of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a\ndeserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran\nfor the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold\nwas so secret.\nThe boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the\nmain islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet.\nZaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island\n(the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter\nmeans small \ufb02at and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another\nmeaningless coincidence was called France.\nOne of the side e\ufb00ects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of\npretty meaningless coincidences.\nBut it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of\nthe project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was \ufb01nally\nto be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination\nfor Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had \ufb01rst decided\nto run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment\nthroughout the Imperial Galaxy - Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the\nZaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof\nthat the whole of known creation had \ufb01nally gone bananas.\nZaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.\nZaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possi-\nbly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought\nto be completely out to lunch.\nPresident?\n27", "318a469b-02ca-4383-a447-12890aff7660": "28 CHAPTER 4.\nNo one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.\nOnly six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which\nthe Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had\nannounced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli:\nhe was the ideal Presidency fodder\nPresident : full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government. The\nterm Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor\nis nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. In the last moments of his\ndying coma he was locked in a statis \ufb01eld which keeps him in a state of perpetual\nunchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without\nany drastic political upheaval, power has simply and e\ufb00ectively moved a rung or\ntwo down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act\nsimply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental assembly headed\nby a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place.\nThe President in particular is very much a \ufb01gurehead - he wields no real\npower whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities\nhe is required to display are not those of leadership but those of \ufb01nely judged\noutrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always\nan infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to\ndraw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the\nmost successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two\nof his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize\nthat the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of\nthese very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded.\nMost of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is\nhandled by a computer. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\u00bf\nWhat they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it.\nHe banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.\nToday was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod\nhad been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s Presidency was all\nabout. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another\nmeaningless coincidence.\nAs he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to\nhimself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and\nspread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He steered with an extra arm\nhe\u2019d recently \ufb01tted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.\n- Hey, - he cooed to himself, - you\u2019re a real cool boy you. - But his nerves\nsang a song shriller than a dog whistle.\nThe island of France was about twenty miles long, \ufb01ve miles across the\nmiddle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as\nan island in its own right as simply a means of de\ufb01ning the sweep and curve of\na huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline\nof the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cli\ufb00s. From the top of the cli\ufb00\nthe land sloped slowly down \ufb01ve miles to the opposite shore.\nOn top of the cli\ufb00s stood a reception committee.\nIt consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the\nHeart of Gold - mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atom-\nineers, two or three green slyph-like maximegalacticans, an octopoid physuc-\nturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the\ncolor blue).

To-\ngether and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of\nphysical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted\nand broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest ex-\ncitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck.\n(An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It\nmight not even have made much di\ufb00erence to them if they\u2019d known exactly how\nmuch power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six\npeople in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to\nwield power but to attract attention away from it.\nZaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.\nThe crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speed-\nboat zipped round the headland into the bay.

They slashed sheets of water\nhissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and\nsank back foaming into the boat\u2019s wake as it careered across the bay.\nZaphod loved e\ufb00ect: it was what he was best at.\nHe twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid\nbeneath the cli\ufb00 face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.\nWithin seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over\nthree billion people. The three billion people weren\u2019t actually there, but they\nwatched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which\nhovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made\namazingly popular tri-D; that\u2019s what they were for.\nHe grinned again. Three billion and six people didn\u2019t know it, but today\nwould be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.\nThe robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two\nheads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except\nfor the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random\ndirections, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidenti\ufb01able, and\nhis chins were almost always unshaven.\nA twenty-foot-high transparent globe \ufb02oated next to his boat, rolling and\nbobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it \ufb02oated a wide semi-circular\nsofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled,\nthe more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again,\nall done for e\ufb00ect as much as anything.\nZaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa.

At any\nmoment, he thought, he might scream.\nWater boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble\nsurged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout.

Pages three to seven of the original version were\nat the moment \ufb02oating soggily on the Damogran sea some \ufb01ve miles out from\nthe bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested\nEagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of\nnest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of papier m@ch@\nand it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of\nit. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of\nthe species but wanted no truck with it.\nZaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently de-\n\ufb02ected the one being o\ufb00ered him by the spider.\n- Hi, - he said again.\nEveryone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled out\nTrillian from the crowd. Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had picked up recently\nwhilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid,\nwith long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and\nridiculously brown eyes.

His\nhighly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green\nrubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service\npolitics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive inde\ufb01nitely\nat sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill e\ufb00ects.\nNot that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would not\nallow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons\nhad \ufb01rst crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain\npanting and heaving on the planet\u2019s virgin shores... when the \ufb01rst rays of the\nbright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the\nforces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside\nin disgust and written them o\ufb00 as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. They never\nevolved again; they should never have survived.\nThe fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained\nstubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? - they said to themselves, - Who\nneeds it?, - and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without\nuntil such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences\nwith surgery.\nMeanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working\novertime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating\njewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron\nmallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the\nVogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazellelike creatures\nwith silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They\nwere no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the\nVogons sat on them anyway.\nThus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the\nVogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few\nshort Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the\npolitical hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of\nthe Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have\nattempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern\nVogon is little di\ufb00erent from his primitive forebears.

Also, he did not like hitch hikers.\nSomewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic\nVogon Jeltz\u2019s \ufb02agship, a small match \ufb02ared nervously. The owner of the match\nwas not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His\nname was Ford Prefect.\nFord Prefect\u2019s original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian\ndialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal.\n/Sid./ Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betel-\ngeuse Seven. Ford\u2019s father was the only man on the entire planet to survive\nthe Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he\nwas never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep\nmystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to\ncollapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford\u2019s father, magnanimously waving\naside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to\nlive on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of\nhis now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue.\nBecause Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually\ndied of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The\nother kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five\ntranslates as \u201dboy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor\nwhy it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven\u201d\u00bf.\nHe looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shad-\nows loomed and leaped with the tiny \ufb02ickering \ufb02ame, but all was quiet. He\nbreathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly\ntribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently\ntaken to employing as catering sta\ufb00 on their long haul \ufb02eets, on the strict un-\nderstanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves.\nThis suited the Dentrassis \ufb01ne, because they loved Vogon money, which is\none of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The\nonly sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon.\nIt was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not\nnow a whi\ufb00 of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.\nHe heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape\nmoving slightly on the \ufb02oor. Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his\npocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He crouched on the\n\ufb02oor. The shape moved again.\nFord Prefect said:\n- I bought some peanuts.\nArthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.\n- Here, have some, - urged Ford, shaking the packet again, - if you\u2019ve never\nbeen through a matter transference beam before you\u2019ve probably lost some salt\nand protein. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit.\n- Whhhrrrr... - said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes.\n- It\u2019s dark, - he said.\n- Yes, - said Ford Prefect, - it\u2019s dark.\n- No light, - said Arthur Dent. - Dark, no light.\nOne of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about\nhuman beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious,\nas in It\u2019s a nice day, or You\u2019re very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down\na thirty-foot well, are you alright?

After a few months\u2019 consideration and\nobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don\u2019t keep\non exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he\nabandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite\nliked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about\nthe terrible number of things they didn\u2019t know about.\n- Yes, - he agreed with Arthur, - no light. - He helped Arthur to some\npeanuts. - How do you feel? - he asked.\n- Like a military academy, - said Arthur, - bits of me keep on passing out.\nFord stared at him blankly in the darkness.\n- If I asked you where the hell we were, - said Arthur weakly, - would I regret\nit?\nFord stood up.\n- We\u2019re safe, - he said.\n- Oh good, - said Arthur.\n- We\u2019re in a small galley cabin, - said Ford, - in one of the spaceships of the\nVogon Constructor Fleet.\n- Ah, - said Arthur, - this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe\nthat I wasn\u2019t previously aware of.\nFord struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous\nshadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged\nhimself apprehensively.

I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?\n- Well, - said Ford, - the Thumb\u2019s an electronic sub-etha signalling device,\nthe roundabout\u2019s at Barnard\u2019s Star six light years away, but otherwise, that\u2019s\nmore or less right.\n- And the bug-eyed monster?\n- Is green, yes.\n- Fine, - said Arthur, - when can I get home?\n- You can\u2019t, - said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.\n- Shade your eyes... - he said, and turned it on.\nEven Ford was surprised.\n- Good grief, - said Arthur, - is this really the interior of a \ufb02ying saucer?\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control\nbridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He\nwished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he\ncould shout at them and feel better. He \ufb02opped as heavily as he could on to\nhis control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be\ngenuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak.\n- Go away! - he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge\nat that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved.

He knew that when a Dentrassi looked\nthat pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship\nthat he could get very angry indeed about.\nFord and Arthur stared about them.\n- Well, what do you think? - said Ford.\n- It\u2019s a bit squalid, isn\u2019t it?\nFord frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidenti\ufb01able bits\nof smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin.\n- Well, this is a working ship, you see, - said Ford. - These are the Dentrassi\nsleeping quarters.\n- I thought you said they were called Vogons or something.\n- Yes, - said Ford, - the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks,\nthey let us on board.\n- I\u2019m confused, - said Arthur.\n- Here, have a look at this, - said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses\nand rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and\nthen sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because\nall mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly\nkilled and dried before being put to service.

It\ntells you everything you need to know about anything. That\u2019s its job.\nArthur turned it over nervously in his hands.\n- I like the cover, - he said. - Don\u2019t Panic. It\u2019s the \ufb01rst helpful or intelligible\nthing anybody\u2019s said to me all day.\n- I\u2019ll show you how it works, - said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who\nwas still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its\ncover.\n- You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the\nindex.\nA screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to \ufb02icker\nacross the surface.\n- You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so. - His \ufb01ngers\ntapped some more keys. - And there we are.\nThe words Vogon Constructor Fleets \ufb02ared in green across the screen.\nFord pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began\nto undulate across it.

He pressed\nthe entry for the relevant page. The screen \ufb02ashed and swirled and resolved\ninto a page of print. Arthur stared at it.\n- It doesn\u2019t have an entry! - he burst out.\nFord looked over his shoulder.\n- Yes it does, - he said, - down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just\nunder Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6.\nArthur followed Ford\u2019s \ufb01nger, and saw where it was pointing. For a moment\nit still didn\u2019t register, then his mind nearly blew up.\n- What? Harmless? Is that all it\u2019s got to say? Harmless! One word!\nFord shrugged.\n- Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a limited\namount of space in the book\u2019s microprocessors, - he said, - and no one knew\nmuch about the Earth of course.\n- Well for God\u2019s sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit.\n- Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry o\ufb00 to the editor. He had\nto trim it a bit, but it\u2019s still an improvement.\n- And what does it say now? - asked Arthur.\n- Mostly harmless, - admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough.\n- Mostly harmless! - shouted Arthur.\n- What was that noise? - hissed Ford.\n- It was me shouting, - shouted Arthur.\n- No! Shut up! - said Ford. I think we\u2019re in trouble.\n- You think we\u2019re in trouble!\nOutside the door were the sounds of marching feet.\n- The Dentrassi? - whispered Arthur.\n- No, those are steel tipped boots, - said Ford.\nThere was a sharp ringing rap on the door.\n- Then who is it? - said Arthur.", "250ec502-a49c-4d64-8285-2b7c4b176fe8": "42 CHAPTER 6.\n- Well, - said Ford, - if we\u2019re lucky it\u2019s just the Vogons come to throw us in\nto space.\n- And if we\u2019re unlucky?\n- If we\u2019re unlucky, - said Ford grimly, - the captain might be serious in his\nthreat that he\u2019s going to read us some of his poetry \ufb01rst...", "0861c703-d3a6-4607-b1e0-0ec7785039d1": "Chapter 7\nVogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.\nThe second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria.

Stomping\naround, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships...\nThe Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled\nover each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said,\n- Well the hours are good...\n- They\u2019d have to be, - agreed Ford.\nArthur twisted his head to look at Ford.\n- Ford, what are you doing? - he asked in an amazed whisper.\n- Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK? - he said.\n- So the hours are pretty good then? - he resumed.\nThe Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the\nmurky depths.\n- Yeah, - he said, - but now you come to mention it, most of the actual\nminutes are pretty lousy.

What is it? The girls? The leather? The\nmachismo? Or do you just \ufb01nd that coming to terms with the mindless tedium\nof it all presents an interesting challenge?\n- Er... - said the guard, - er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it\nreally. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon\n- you know, the uniform, the lowslung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium...\n- There you are Arthur, - said Ford with the air of someone reaching the\nconclusion of his argument, - you think you\u2019ve got problems.\nArthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his\nhome planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already and he didn\u2019t like\nthe sound of being thrown into space very much.\n- Try and understand his problem, - insisted Ford. - Here he is poor lad, his\nentire life\u2019s work is stamping around, throwing people o\ufb00 spaceships...\n- And shouting, - added the guard.\n- And shouting, sure, - said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round\nhis neck in friendly condescension, - ...and he doesn\u2019t even know why he\u2019s doing\nit!\nArthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture,\nbecause he was too asphyxicated to speak.\nDeep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.\n- Well. Now you put it like that I suppose...\n- Good lad! - encouraged Ford.\n- But alright, - went on the rumblings, - so what\u2019s the alternative?", "17751826-39f1-4797-b772-471680e02db5": "47\n- Well, - said Ford, brightly but slowly, - stop doing it of course!

He was obviously quite touched.\n- No, I think if it\u2019s all the same to you, - he said, - I\u2019d better get you both\nshoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting\nI\u2019ve got to do.\nIt wasn\u2019t all the same to Ford Prefect after all.\n- Come on now... but look! - he said, less slowly, less brightly.\n- Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn... - said Arthur without any clear in\ufb02ection.\n- But hang on, - pursued Ford, - there\u2019s music and art and things to tell you\nabout yet!

Doesn\u2019t that stir anything in you?\n- No, - said the guard, - not really. But I\u2019ll mention it to my aunt.\nIf he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself\ntight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the ship\u2019s engines.\nThey were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diam-\neter and ten feet long.\n- Potentially bright lad I thought, - he said and slumped against the curved\nwall.\nArthur was still lying in the curve of the \ufb02oor where he had fallen.

It has been\ncompiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many di\ufb00erent\neditorships.

You just won\u2019t believe how vastly\nhugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it\u2019s a long way down the\nroad to the chemist, but that\u2019s just peanuts to space. Listen... - and so on.\n(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things\nyou really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Beth-\nselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visit-\ning tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and\nthe amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your\nbodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally\nimportant to get a receipt.)\nTo be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances be-\ntween the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide\u2019s intro-\nduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in\nreading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.\nThe simple truth is that interstellar distances will not \ufb01t into the human\nimagination.\nEven light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years\nto realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes\neight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and\nfour years more to arrive at Sol\u2019s nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.\nFor light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for\ninstance, takes rather longer: \ufb01ve hundred thousand years.\nThe record for hitch hiking this distance is just under \ufb01ve years, but you\ndon\u2019t get to see much on the way.\nThe Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air\nyou can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However\nit goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the\nchances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two\nto the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine\nto one against.\nBy a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an\nIslington \ufb02at where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice\n49", "ba3416f0-13da-48d8-8dd0-20a716556398": "50 CHAPTER 8.\ngirl whom he totally failed to get o\ufb00 with - she went o\ufb00 with a gatecrasher.\nThough the planet Earth, the Islington \ufb02at and the telephone have all now\nbeen demolished, it is comforting to re\ufb02ect that they are all in some small way\ncommemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were\nrescued.", "6c8cf0a3-069f-463b-8305-f4f673fb44de": "Chapter 9\nA computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close\nitself for no apparent reason.\nThis was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.\nA hole had just appeared in the Galaxy.

In those days spirits\nwere brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women,\nand small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures\nfrom Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty\ndeeds, to boldly split in\ufb01nitives that no man had split before - and thus was the\nEmpire forged.\nMany men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural\nand nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor - at least no\none worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most successful merchants\nlife inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that\nthis was therefore the fault of the worlds they\u2019d settled on - none of them was\nentirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn\u2019t quite right in the later part of\nthe afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the\nwrong shade of pink.\nAnd thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of special-\nist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home of this industry\nwas the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through\nwhite holes in space to form it into dream planets - gold planets, platinum plan-\nets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes - all lovingly made to meet the\nexacting standards that the Galaxy\u2019s richest men naturally came to expect.\nBut so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the\nrichest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject\npoverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen\nsilence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of\nscholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of\na planned political economy.\nMagrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity\nof legend.\nIn these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it.\n75", "16733ae5-1c03-4808-a62d-b9f2aa43b236": "76 CHAPTER 15.", "9b8ce9d4-1e3c-4732-a0ff-dafcb90f22e9": "Chapter 16\nArthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge.

He shrugged.\n- I think it\u2019s just a dead planet, - he said.\n- The suspense is killing me, - said Arthur testily.\nStress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of\nthe Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in any way be\nexacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance.\nThe planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.\nThe deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic\ndefence system will result merely in the breakage of three co\ufb00ee cups and a\nmicecage, the bruising of somebody\u2019s upper arm, and the untimely creation and\nsudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale.\nIn order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revela-\ntion will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise.

He\nhad found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup\n\ufb01lled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way\nit functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made\nan instant but highly detailed examination of the subject\u2019s taste buds, a spec-\ntroscopic analysis of the subject\u2019s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental\nsignals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject\u2019s brain to\nsee what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did\nthis because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not\nquite, entirely unlike tea. The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by\nthe Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers all\nthe major land masses of the \ufb01rst three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system.\nArthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the screens\nagain and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past. It\nsuddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him.\n- Is it safe? - he said.\n- Magrathea\u2019s been dead for \ufb01ve million years, - said Zaphod, - of course\nit\u2019s safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now. -\nAt which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the\nbridge - a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It\npreceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice\nsaid - Greetings to you...\nSomeone from the dead planet was talking to them.\n- Computer! - shouted Zaphod.\n- Hi there!\n- What the photon is it?\n- Oh, just some \ufb01ve-million-year-old tape that\u2019s being broadcast at us.\n- A what? A recording?\n- Shush! - said Ford. - It\u2019s carrying on.\nThe voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with\nquite unmistakable menace.\n- This is a recorded announcement, - it said, - as I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re all out\nat the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your\nesteemed visit...\n(\u201dA voice from ancient Magrathea!\u201d shouted Zaphod. \u201dOK, OK,\u201d said Ford.)\n- ...but regrets, - continued the voice, - that the entire planet is temporarily\n81", "aca2341d-9054-4e19-a2ea-bed2457ed607": "82 CHAPTER 17.\nclosed for business.

Got that, computer?\n- I got it, - said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed.\nThey waited.\nAfter a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice.\n- We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed an-\nnouncements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements,\nwhen our clients will once again be able to select from all that\u2019s best in con-\ntemporary geography. - The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. -\nMeanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to\nleave. Now.\nArthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.\n- Well, I suppose we\u2019d better be going then, hadn\u2019t we? - he suggested.\n- Shhh! - said Zaphod. - There\u2019s absolutely nothing to be worried about.\n- Then why\u2019s everyone so tense?\n- They\u2019re just interested! - shouted Zaphod. - Computer, start a descent\ninto the atmosphere and prepare for landing.\nThis time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly cold.\n- It is most gratifying, - it said, - that your enthusiasm for our planet con-\ntinues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles\ncurrently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to\nall of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are\nof course merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom in future\nlives... thank you.\nThe voice snapped o\ufb00.\n- Oh, - said Trillian.\n- Er... - said Arthur.\n- Well? - said Ford.\n- Look, - said Zaphod, - will you get it into your heads? That\u2019s just a\nrecorded message. It\u2019s millions of years old. It doesn\u2019t apply to us, get it?\n- What, - said Trillian quietly, - about the missiles?\n- Missiles? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\nFord tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen. Clear in\nthe distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere\ntowards the ship. A quick change of magni\ufb01cation brought them into close focus\n- two massively real rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it\nwas shocking.\n- I think they\u2019re going to have a very good try at applying to us, said Ford.\nZaphod stared at them in astonishment.\n- Hey this is terri\ufb01c! - he said. - Someone down there is trying to kill us!\n- Terri\ufb01c, - said Arthur.\n- But don\u2019t you see what this means?\n- Yes.

Or\nsomething...\n- Good luck guys, - chirped the computer, - impact minus thirty seconds...\nFord leapt to the controls - only a few of them made any immediate sense\nto him so he pulled those. The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocked\njets tried to push it every which way simultaneously. He released half of them\nand the ship span round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come,\nstraight towards the oncoming missiles.\nAir cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown\nagainst them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held them \ufb02attened and\nsquirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic\ndesperation and \ufb01nally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part\nof the guidance system.\nThe lever snapped o\ufb00. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards. The\ncrew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitch\nHiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console\nwith the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared\nto listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of\nAntares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but\nmuch sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid", "b899f50d-6ad9-42fb-8cac-d10d7278b3fc": "84 CHAPTER 17.\nfor them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and\nthe ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone.\nIt was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained\na nasty bruise to the upper arm.

The safety of the crew is\nabsolutely assured.\n- Impact minus twenty seconds, guys... - said the computer.\n- Then turn the bloody engines back on! - bawled Zaphod.\n- OK, sure thing, guys, - said the computer. With a subtle roar the engines\ncut back in, the ship smoothly \ufb02attened out of its dive and headed back towards\nthe missiles again.\nThe computer started to sing.\n- When you walk through the storm... - it whined nasally, - hold your head\nup high...\nZaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of what\nthey quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction.\n- And don\u2019t... be afraid... of the dark! - Eddie wailed.\nThe ship, in \ufb02attening out had in fact \ufb02attened out upside down and lying\non the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to\nreach the guidance systems.\n- At the end of the storm... - crooned Eddie.\nThe two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards\nthe ship.\n- ...is a golden sky...\nBut by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their\n\ufb02ight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under\nit.\n- And the sweet silver songs of the lark...

Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the\nillusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely\nmanicured garden.

OK, here we go.\nZaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford.\n- Well I hope you all have a really miserable time, - complained Arthur.\n- Don\u2019t worry, - Marvin assured him, - they will.\nIn a few seconds they had disappeared from view.\nArthur stamped around in a hu\ufb00, and then decided that a whale\u2019s graveyard\nis not on the whole a good place to stamp around in.\nMarvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself o\ufb00.", "5fef2c7f-a837-43ff-9d51-e24e4891eaa2": "93\nZaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying\nto hide it by striding purposefully. He \ufb02ung the torch beam around. The walls\nwere covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, the air thick with decay.\n- There, what did I tell you? - he said. - An inhabited planet. Magrathea, -\nand he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile \ufb02oor.\nTrillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it\nwas less thoroughly squalid.\nAt intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics - simple\nangular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied one of them\nbut could not interpret any sense in them. She called to Zaphod.\n- Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?\n- I think they\u2019re just strange symbols of some kind, - said Zaphod, hardly\nglancing back.\nTrillian shrugged and hurried after him.\nFrom time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish\nchambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment. He\ndragged Zaphod into one to have a look. Trillian followed.\n- Look, - said Ford, - you reckon this is Magrathea...\n- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - and we heard the voice, right?\n- OK, so I\u2019ve bought the fact that it\u2019s Magrathea - for the moment. What\nyou have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it. You\ndidn\u2019t just look it up in a star atlas, that\u2019s for sure.\n- Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky guesses. Easy.\n- And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?\n- I stole it to look for a lot of things.\n- A lot of things? - said Ford in surprise. - Like what?\n- I don\u2019t know.\n- What?\n- I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for.\n- Why not?\n- Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn\u2019t be\nable to look for them.\n- What, are you crazy?\n- It\u2019s a possibility I haven\u2019t ruled out yet, - said Zaphod quietly. - I only know\nas much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions.\nAnd its current conditions are not good.\nFor a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind\nsuddenly full of worry.\n- Listen old friend, if you want to... - started Ford eventually.\n- No, wait... I\u2019ll tell you something, - said Zaphod. - I freewheel a lot. I\nget an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I\u2019ll become\nPresident of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it\u2019s easy. I decide to steal this ship.\nI decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it\ncan best be done, right, but it always works out. It\u2019s like having a Galacticredit\ncard which keeps on working though you never send o\ufb00 the cheques. And then\nwhenever I stop and think why did I want to do something? - how did I work\nout how to do it? - I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it.\nLike I have now.

About the fact that part of\nmy mind just didn\u2019t seem to work properly. Then it occurred to me that the\nway it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas\nwith, without telling me about it. I put the two ideas together and decided that\nmaybe that somebody had locked o\ufb00 part of my mind for that purpose, which\nwas why I couldn\u2019t use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check.\n- I went to the ship\u2019s medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelo-\ngraphic screen. I went through every major screening test on both my heads -\nall the tests I had to go through under government medical o\ufb03cers before my\nnomination for Presidency could be properly rati\ufb01ed. They showed up nothing.\nNothing unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, ir-\nresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn\u2019t have guessed. And\nno other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, completely at random.\nNothing. Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the\nresults from the other head. Still nothing. Finally I got silly, because I\u2019d given\nit all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I\npacked it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green\n\ufb01lter. You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when I\nwas a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?\nFord nodded.\n- And there it was, - said Zaphod, - clear as day. A whole section in the\nmiddle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else\naround them. Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically\ntraumatised those two lumps of cerebellum.\nFord stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white.\n- Somebody did that to you? - whispered Ford.\n- Yeah.\n- But have you any idea who? Or why?\n- Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was.\n- You know? How do you know?\n- Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. They\nleft them there for me to see.\nFord stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl.\n- Initials? Burnt into your brain?\n- Yeah.\n- Well, what were they, for God\u2019s sake?\nZaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he looked away.\n- Z.B., - he said.\nAt that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started\nto pour into the chamber.\n- I\u2019ll tell you about it later, - choked Zaphod as all three passed out.", "0838f4ec-b54c-464f-87ad-ad462eeacefb": "Chapter 21\nOn the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.\nFord had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the\nGalaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random.\nThe Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and\ncontains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the\ntime.\nOne of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the ex-\nperiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of\nMaximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philol-\nogy, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical per-\nception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with\nZaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had\nhappened to all the biros he\u2019d bought over the past few years.\nThere followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited\nall the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came\nup with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the\ntime. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited\nby humanoids, reptiloids, \ufb01shoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades\nof the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.\nAnd it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping\naway quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could\nenjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and\ngenerally leading the biro equivalent of the good life.\nAnd as theories go this was all very \ufb01ne and pleasant until Veet Voojagig\nsuddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a\nwhile driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon\nhe was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was \ufb01nally sent into tax exile,\nwhich is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of\nthemselves in public.\nWhen one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voo-\njagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited\nby a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he\nwas later discovered to be lying.\nThere did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Al-\ntairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course\nZaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s highly pro\ufb01table second-hand biro business.\nArthur read this, and put the book down.\n95", "7d301b10-2947-4c44-97df-78a18d0bfe35": "96 CHAPTER 21.\nThe robot still sat there, completely inert.\nArthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked around the\ncrater. He watched two suns set magni\ufb01cently over Magrathea.\nHe went back down into the crater. He woke the robot up because even a\nmanically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.\n- Night\u2019s falling, - he said. - Look robot, the stars are coming out.\nFrom the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only\nvery faintly, but they were there to be seen.\nThe robot obediently looked at them, then looked back.\n- I know, - he said. - Wretched isn\u2019t it?\n- But that sunset! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams...\nthe two suns! It was like mountains of \ufb01re boiling into space.\n- I\u2019ve seen it, - said Marvin. - It\u2019s rubbish.\n- We only ever had the one sun at home, - persevered Arthur, - I came from\na planet called Earth you know.\n- I know, - said Marvin, - you keep going on about it. It sounds awful.\n- Ah no, it was a beautiful place.\n- Did it have oceans?\n- Oh yes, - said Arthur with a sigh, - great wide rolling blue oceans...\n- Can\u2019t bear oceans, - said Marvin.\n- Tell me, - inquired Arthur, - do you get on well with other robots?\n- Hate them, - said Marvin. - Where are you going?\nArthur couldn\u2019t bear any more. He had got up again.\n- I think I\u2019ll just take another walk, - he said.\n- Don\u2019t blame you, - said Marvin and counted \ufb01ve hundred and ninety-seven\nthousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later.\nArthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little\nmore enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of the crater.\nBecause the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall\nwas very rapid and it was by now very dark.

He was tallish, elderly and dressed\nin a single long grey robe. When he turned his face was thin and distinguished,\ncareworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he\ndidn\u2019t turn yet, not even to react to Arthur\u2019s yelp of surprise.\nEventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned.\nHis face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the\nsource of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some\nkind - a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it.\nThe man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.\n- You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet, - he said.\n- Who... who are you? - stammered Arthur.\nThe man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face.\n- My name is not important, - he said.\nHe seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly some-\nthing he felt he didn\u2019t have to rush at. Arthur felt awkward.\n- I... er... you startled me... - he said, lamely.\nThe man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows.\n- Hmmmm? - he said.\n- I said you startled me.\n- Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you.\nArthur frowned at him.\n- But you shot at us! There were missiles... - he said.\nThe man chuckled slightly.\n- An automatic system, - he said and gave a small sigh. - Ancient computers\nranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages\nhang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think they take the occasional pot shot\nto relieve the monotony.\nHe looked gravely at Arthur and said,\n- I\u2019m a great fan of science you know.\n- Oh... er, really? - said Arthur, who was beginning to \ufb01nd the man\u2019s\ncurious, kindly manner disconcerting.\n- Oh, yes, - said the old man, and simply stopped talking again.\n- Ah, - said Arthur, - er... - He had an odd felling of being like a man in the\nact of adultery who is surprised when the woman\u2019s husband wanders into the\nroom, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and\nleaves again.\n97", "42ec165b-9a43-446c-a71e-c84fbe8c99e2": "98 CHAPTER 22.\n- You seem ill at ease, - said the old man with polite concern.\n- Er, no... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren\u2019t really expecting to \ufb01nd\nanybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something...\n- Dead? - said the old man. - Good gracious no, we have but slept.\n- Slept? - said Arthur incredulously.\n- Yes, through the economic recession you see, - said the old man, apparently\nunconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or\nnot.\n- Er, economic recession?\n- Well you see, \ufb01ve million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and\nseeing that custom-made planets are something of a luxury commodity you see...\nHe paused and looked at Arthur.\n- You know we built planets do you? - he asked solemnly.\n- Well yes, - said Arthur, - I\u2019d sort of gathered...\n- Fascinating trade, - said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes,\n- doing the coastlines was always my favourite.

But conversely, the dolphins had always believed\nthat they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons.\nCuriously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruc-\ntion of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the\ndanger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing at-\ntempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and\nleft the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.\nThe last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophis-\nticated attempt to do a double-backwardssomersault through a hoop whilst\nwhistling the \u201dStar Sprangled Banner\u201d, but in fact the message was this: So\nlong and thanks for all the \ufb01sh.\nIn fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dol-\nphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories\nrunning round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle\nexperiments on man.

It sped swiftly. Arthur\u2019s\ncompanion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple\nof occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking\nif he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that.\nArthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the black-\nness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of\nmotion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving\nat all.\nThen a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds\nhad grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them\nat a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be. He\npeered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped\nin alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed\ncertain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and\nArthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next thing\nhe was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He\ntwisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly\nin the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what\nhad happened.\nThey had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed had been\ntheir own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground,\nthe mouth of the tunnel. The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the\ntunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an\nhour.\nHe closed his eyes in terror.\nAfter a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a\nslight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they\nwere gradually gliding to a gentle halt.\nHe opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, threading\nand weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of\nconverging tunnels. When they \ufb01nally stopped it was in a small chamber of\ncurved steel. Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther\nend of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was\nirritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it\nproperly or tell how near or far it was.

It is a little too... large. We are about to pass\nthrough a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you.\nArthur made nervous noises.\nSlartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly.\n- It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight.\nThe car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur\nhad a fairly clear idea of what in\ufb01nity looked like.\nIt wasn\u2019t in\ufb01nity in fact. In\ufb01nity itself looks \ufb02at and uninteresting. Looking\nup into the night sky is looking into in\ufb01nity - distance is incomprehensible and\ntherefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything\nbut in\ufb01nite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of in\ufb01nity\nfar better than in\ufb01nity itself.\nArthur\u2019s senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed he\nknew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the\ngateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering\nwall behind them.\nThe wall.\nThe wall de\ufb01ed the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so\nparalysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond\nthe reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man.\nThe wall appeared perfectly \ufb02at. It would take the \ufb01nest laser measuring\nequipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to in\ufb01nity, as it dropped\ndizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again\nthirteen light seconds away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow\nsphere, a sphere over three million miles across and \ufb02ooded with unimaginable\nlight.\n- Welcome, - said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, trav-\nelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into\nthe mindboggling space, - welcome, - he said, - to our factory \ufb02oor.\nArthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged away before\nthem, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of\ncurious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy\nspherical shapes that hung in the space.\n- This, - said Slartibartfast, - is where we make most of our planets you see.\n- You mean, - said Arthur, trying to form the words, - you mean you\u2019re\nstarting it all up again now?\n- No no, good heavens no, - exclaimed the old man, - no, the Galaxy isn\u2019t\nnearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we\u2019ve been awakened to perform just\none extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension.\nIt may interest you... there in the distance in front of us.\nArthur followed the old man\u2019s \ufb01nger, till he was able to pick out the \ufb02oating\nstructure he was pointing out.

For a few seconds he\nsat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to \ufb01nd\nsomewhere to settle down and make sense.\nPart of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking\nat and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to\ncountenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in\nthat direction.\nThe \ufb02ash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.\n- The Earth... - whispered Arthur.\n- Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact, - said Slartibartfast cheerfully. - We\u2019re\nmaking a copy from our original blueprints.\nThere was a pause.\n- Are you trying to tell me, - said Arthur, slowly and with control, - that\nyou originally... made the Earth?\n- Oh yes, - said Slartibartfast. - Did you ever go to a place... I think it was\ncalled Norway?\n- No, - said Arthur, - no, I didn\u2019t.\n- Pity, - said Slartibartfast, - that was one of mine. Won an award you know.\nLovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its destruction.\n- You were upset!\n- Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered so much.

No, look\nyou see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them. They\nwere often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stu\ufb00.

Why do they die? Why do they want\nto spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?\nMany many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional\nbeings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe is\nnot dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the\nmeaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra\nCricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily\napparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve\ntheir problems once and for all.\nAnd to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which\nwas so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected\nup it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of\nrice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it o\ufb00.\nIt was the size of a small city.\nIts main console was installed in a specially designed executive o\ufb03ce, mounted\non an enormous executive desk of \ufb01nest ultramahagony topped with rich ultra-\nred leather. The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants\nand tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their\nfamilies were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked\nout upon a tree-lined public square.\nOn the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with\nbrief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the o\ufb03ce.

After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep.\nIt said:\n- What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest\ncomputer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?\nLunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.\n107", "7625cce8-ef00-42e2-a794-64ea9d8dbbc8": "108 CHAPTER 25.\n- Your task, O Computer... - began Fook.\n- No, wait a minute, this isn\u2019t right, - said Lunkwill, worried. - We distinctly\ndesigned this computer to be the greatest one ever and we\u2019re not making do\nwith second best. Deep Thought, - he addressed the computer, - are you not as\nwe designed you to be, the greatest most powerful computer in all time?\n- I described myself as the second greatest, - intoned Deep Thought, - and\nsuch I am.\nAnother worried look passed between the two programmers.

There is\nan answer. But, - he added, - I\u2019ll have to think about it.\nA sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door \ufb02ew open and two\nangry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan Uni-\nversity burst into the room, thrusting aside the ine\ufb00ectual \ufb02unkies who tried to\nbar their way.\n- We demand admission! - shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a\npretty young secretary in the throat.\n- Come on, - shouted the older one, - you can\u2019t keep us out! - He pushed a\njunior programmer back through the door.\n- We demand that you can\u2019t keep us out! - bawled the younger one, though\nhe was now \ufb01rmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to\nstop him.\n- Who are you? - said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. - What do you\nwant?\n- I am Majikthise! - announced the older one.\n- And I demand that I am Vroomfondel! - shouted the younger one.\nMajikthise turned on Vroomfondel.\n- It\u2019s alright, - he explained angrily, - you don\u2019t need to demand that.\n- Alright! - bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. - I am Vroom-\nfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact!

Today however the sun was\nshining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation\nthat all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact\nthat the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited\npeople. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured \ufb02ags were \ufb02uttering\nin the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.\nArthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so\nmuch as a body to his name, but before he had time to re\ufb02ect on this a voice\nrang out across the square and called for everyone\u2019s attention.\nA man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly\ndominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy.\n- O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought! - he cried out. -\nHonoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most\nTruly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known...

You remember Yooden, Ford?\n- Yeah, - said Ford, - he was that guy we met when we were kids, the\nArcturan captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you bust your way\ninto his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid he\u2019d ever met.\n- What\u2019s all this? - said Trillian.\n- Ancient history, - said Ford, - when we were kids together on Betelgeuse.\nThe Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the\nGalactic Centre and the outlying regions The Betelgeuse trading scouts used\nto \ufb01nd the markets and the Arcturans would supply them. There was a lot of\ntrouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and\nthe megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields\nknown to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit\nround a planet they would eclipse the sun.\n- One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one.

You never told me.\n- No.\n- What did he say? What did he come to see you about?\n- He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should steal it.\n- His idea?\n- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - and the only possible way of stealing it was to be\nat the launching ceremony.\nFord gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with\nlaughter.\n- Are you telling me, - he said, - that you set yourself up to become President\nof the Galaxy just to steal that ship?\n- That\u2019s it, - said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people\nlocked away in a room with soft walls.\n- But why? - said Ford. - What\u2019s so important about having it?\n- Dunno, - said Zaphod, - I think if I\u2019d consciously known what was so\nimportant about it and what I would need it for it would have showed up on\nthe brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think Yooden told\nme a lot of things that are still locked away.\n- So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result\nof Yooden talking to you?\n- He was a hell of a talker.\n- Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know.\nZaphod shrugged.\n- I mean, don\u2019t you have any inkling of the reasons for all this? asked Ford.\nZaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds.\n- No, - he said at last, - I don\u2019t seem to be letting myself into any of my\nsecrets.

Will you try to\ncomprehend what I\u2019m telling you? That drink...\n- That drink, - said the machine sweetly, - was individually tailored to meet\nyour personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure.\n- Ah, - said Arthur, - so I\u2019m a masochist on diet am I?\n- Share and Enjoy.\n- Oh shut up.\n- Will that be all?\nArthur decided to give up.\n- Yes, - he said.\nThen he decided he\u2019d be dammed if he\u2019d give up.\n- No, - he said, - look, it\u2019s very, very simple... all I want... is a cup of tea.\nYou are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen.\nAnd he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about China,\nhe told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He\ntold it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn.\nHe told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn\u2019t get scalded.\nHe even told it (brie\ufb02y) about the history of the East India Company.\n- So that\u2019s it, is it? - said the Nutri-Matic when he had \ufb01nished.\n- Yes, - said Arthur, - that is what I want.\n- You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?", "5819a822-597c-42a8-ae21-b7eff5395682": "15\n- Er, yes.

There\u2019s no power anywhere in the ship.\nFord moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his\nforehead and slumped back against the wall.\n- Nothing we can do, - he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip.\nWhen Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had been\ndemolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at all good at it,\nand his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches.\nWhenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the\nback of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow.\nThe image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys \ufb02inging it at him\nsuddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.\nA peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across\nhis cheeks and heating his brow.\nHe started to speak, and stopped.\nHe started to speak again and stopped again.\n17", "fe5695fc-73e3-492e-94e2-dffa2067e691": "18 CHAPTER 3.\nFinally he managed to speak.\n- Er, - he said. He cleared his throat.\n- Tell me, - he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all turned\nto stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen.\n- Tell me, - he said again, - did the computer say what was occupying it? I\njust ask out of interest...\nTheir eyes were riveted on him.\n- And, er... well that\u2019s it really, just asking.\nZaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scru\ufb00 of the neck.\n- What have you done to it, Monkeyman? - he breathed.\n- Well, - said Arthur, - nothing in fact.

Slowly they turned their heads to\nlook, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the\nsame place.\n- Now. Who disturbs me at this time? - said the small, bent, gaunt \ufb01gure\nstanding by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge. His two small wispy-\nhaired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of\nthe birth of the galaxies themselves.

Oh.\n- But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod...\n- Yeah well... - Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this con-\nversation, and Ford\u2019s heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were\nticking away fast.

Have you forgotten?\n- Could we go into this later?\n- Have you forgotten! - insisted the ghost.\n- Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your brain when\nyou get the job you know. If they\u2019d found my head full of tricksy ideas I\u2019d have\nbeen right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial\nsta\ufb00, a \ufb02eet of ships and a couple of slit throats.\n- Ah, - nodded the ghost in satisfaction, - then you do remember!\nHe paused for a moment.\n- Good, - he said and the noise stopped.\n- Forty-eight seconds, - said Ford.

Try me.\n- Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did Yooden\nVranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher. Somewhere in the\nshadows behind is another man, being, something, with ultimate power.

He didn\u2019t need\nthis, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. He hadn\u2019t\nasked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he\nwould probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least\n\ufb01fty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they\ncould be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he would probably have\nadded something passionate on the subject of food.\nOne thing he didn\u2019t want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled\nthe Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because\nif it wasn\u2019t him it would only be someone else.

He tried to stagger back to the elevator - a\npointless manoeuvre he realized, but the only one he could think of.\nSuddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from this one,\nhe caught sight of a \ufb01gure as it lunged into view, a man. The man saw him.\n- Beeblebrox, over here! - he shouted.\nZaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building.\n- No, - called Zaphod, - Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?\n- A friend! - shouted back the man.

A gigantic black shape\nwas moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and shape of a tank.\n- Holy photon, what\u2019s that?\n- A tank, - said the man, - Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get you.\n- Should we leave?\n- I think we should.\n- Marvin! - called Zaphod.\n- What do you want?\nMarvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at\nthem.\n- You see that robot coming towards us?\nMarvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over\nthe bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body. He looked back up at\nthe tank.\n- I suppose you want me to stop it, - he said.\n- Yeah.\n- Whilst you save your skins.\n- Yeah, - said Zaphod, - get in there!\n- Just so long, - said Marvin, - as I know where I stand.\nThe man tugged at Zaphod\u2019s arm, and Zaphod followed him o\ufb00 down the\ncorridor.\nA point occurred to him about this.\n- Where are we going? - he said.\n- Zarniwoop\u2019s o\ufb03ce.\n- Is this any time to keep an appointment?\n- Come on.", "020f9ae3-93ea-4901-b2b7-d5dce30bba47": "38 CHAPTER 6.", "1872261d-1d51-4c49-bb37-27a06d2c5277": "Chapter 7\nMarvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a particularly\nsmall robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the\ncontinual barrage which the building was still undergoing.\nHe did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a\nhalt in front of him. The tank examined him with a probe. The probe withdrew.\nMarvin stood there.\n- Out of my way little robot, - growled the tank.\n- I\u2019m afraid, - said Marvin, - that I\u2019ve been left here to stop you.\nThe probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again.\n- You? Stop me? - roared the tank. - Go on!\n- No, really I have, - said Marvin simply.\n- What are you armed with? - roared the tank in disbelief.\n- Guess, - said Marvin.\nThe tank\u2019s engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized electronic\nrelays deep in its micro-brain \ufb02ipped backwards and forwards in consternation.\n- Guess? - said the tank.\nZaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second\nand along a third. The building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled\nZaphod. If they wanted to blow the building up, why was it taking so long?\nWith di\ufb03culty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked\ndoors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside.\nAll this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this notlying-on-the-beach-\nhaving-a-wonderful-time, and for what? A single chair, a single desk and a single\ndirty ashtray in an undecorated o\ufb03ce. The desk, apart from a bit of dancing\ndust and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty.\n- Where, - said Zaphod, - is Zarniwoop? - feeling that his already tenuous\ngrasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip.\n- He\u2019s on an intergalactic cruise, - said the man.\nZaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a barrel of\nlaughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and\ndown heaving corridors, breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in\nempty o\ufb03ces.\n- Let me introduce myself, - the man said, - My name is Roosta, and this is\nmy towel.\n- Hello Roosta, - said Zaphod.\n- Hello, towel, - he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty old\n\ufb02owery towel.

No life moved across its surface. The ground, like that of many\nplanets in this part of the Galaxy, had long been deserted.\nThe howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old\ndecaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the\nbottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the\nsurface of this world. At the top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy,\nevil smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here.\nThe howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over\na pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the\nlargest of the abandoned cities.\nThis pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the repu-\ntation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy.

From within it was something\nmore monstrous than the mind can comprehend.\nAbout a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked\nand blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably\nhave to be described as a landing pad of sorts. That is to say that scattered\nover a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed\nbuildings.\nFlitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that was waiting\nfor something.\nThe mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a distant\nspeck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks.\nThe larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the\nGalaxy o\ufb03ce building, descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World\nB.\nAs it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that\nhad grown up between the two men.\nHe stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said:\n- Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do.\nZaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing\nunspoken thoughts with Marvin.\n- Yeah? - he said.\n47", "8ce15c7e-18e2-439b-918d-3605431ede29": "48 CHAPTER 9.\n- The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not\ngo out of the door, - said Roosta, - go out of the window.\n- Good luck, - he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing from\nZaphod\u2019s life as mysteriously as he had entered it.\nZaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked it. He\nshrugged and returned to the corner.\nTwo minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage.\nIts escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force beams and soared o\ufb00 into\nthe air again, bound for Frogstar World A, an altogether more congenial spot.\nThey never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its\nsurface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.\nZaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the silent dusty\nrubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He felt that he was at the\nlowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he\nfelt unloved. Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with.\nHe looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split round\nthe door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some miracle was\nclosed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he thought that if his\nstrange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through\njust to tell him what he had told him, then there must be a good reason for\nit. With Marvin\u2019s help he got the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust\naroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one\nwas surrounded, e\ufb00ectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of the world\noutside.\nNot that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he saw when\nhe looked down. Zarniwoop\u2019s o\ufb03ce was on the \ufb01fteenth \ufb02oor. The building had\nlanded at a tilt of about forty-\ufb01ve degrees, but still the descent looked heart-\nstopping.\nEventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that Mar-\nvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out on\nto the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin followed him, and together\nthey began to crawl slowly and painfully down the \ufb01fteen \ufb02oors that separated\nthem from the ground.\nAs he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and\nthe terrifying distance down made his heads spin.\nThe occasional remark from Marvin of the order of \u201dThis is the sort of thing\nyou lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for information\u201d, did little to improve his\nstate of mind.\nAbout half-way down the side of the shattered building they stopped to\nrest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that\nMarvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. Eventually he realized this\nwasn\u2019t so. The robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood.\nA large, scraggy black bird came \ufb02apping through the slowly settling clouds\nof dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window\nledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded its ungainly wings and teetered\nawkwardly on its perch.\nIts wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck\nseemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was \ufb02at, the beak underdeveloped,\nand half-way along the underside of its wings the vestiges of something handlike\ncould be clearly seen.", "9fa03556-08b3-4b7d-ae1f-7168f5335976": "49\nIn fact, it looked almost human.\nIt turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion.\n- Go away, - said Zaphod.\n- OK, - muttered the bird morosely and \ufb02apped o\ufb00 into the dust again.\nZaphod watched its departure in bewilderment.\n- Did that bird just talk to me? - he asked Marvin nervously. He was quite\nprepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinating.\n- Yes, - con\ufb01rmed Marvin.\n- Poor souls, - said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod\u2019s ear.\nTwisting round violently to \ufb01nd the source of the voice nearly caused Zaphod\nto fall o\ufb00 the building.

Never-\ntheless, it spoke again.\n- A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight.\nZaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In other cir-\ncumstances it would even be described as soothing. There is, however, nothing\nsoothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, partic-\nularly if you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a\nledge eight storeys up a crashed building.\n- Hey, er... - he stammered.\n- Shall I tell you their story? - inquired the voice quietly.\n- Hey, who are you? - panted Zaphod. - Where are you?\n- Later then, perhaps, - murmured the voice. - I am Gargravarr. I am the\nCustodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.\n- Why can\u2019t I see...\n- You will \ufb01nd your progress down the building greatly facilitated, - the voice\nlifted, - if you move about two yards to your left. Why don\u2019t you try it?\nZaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the\nway down the side of the building. Gratefully he shifted himself across to them.\n- Why don\u2019t I see you again at the bottom? - said the voice in his ear, and\nas it spoke it faded.\n- Hey, - called out Zaphod, - Where are you...\n- It\u2019ll only take a couple of minutes... - said the voice very faintly.\n- Marvin, - said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to\nhim, - Did a... did a voice just...\n- Yes, - Marvin replied tersely.\nZaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again. They were\ncompletely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal\nobject in his pocket. He put them on. He would \ufb01nd his way down the building\nmore comfortably if he didn\u2019t actually have to look at what he was doing.\nMinutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the\nbuilding and, once more removing his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground.\nMarvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and\nrubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to move.\n- Ah, there you are, - said the voice suddenly in Zaphod\u2019s ear, - excuse me\nleaving you like that, it\u2019s just that I have a terrible head for heights. At least,\n- it added wistfully, - I did have a terrible head for heights.", "4e7f8b59-3ac4-4468-8e96-96437e5a3106": "50 CHAPTER 9.\nZaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed\nsomething which might be the source of the voice.

Things to do, people to see. - After what seemed like a\nsort of ethereal sigh it added, - You know how it is with bodies.\nZaphod wasn\u2019t sure about this.\n- I thought I did, - he said.\n- I only hope it\u2019s gone for a rest cure, - continued the voice, - the way it\u2019s\nbeen living recently it must be on its last elbows.\n- Elbows? - said Zaphod, - don\u2019t you mean last legs?\nThe voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. He\ndidn\u2019t know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing. Then the\nvoice spoke again.\n- So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?\n- Er, well, - said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, - this\ncat\u2019s in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and take in a look at the\nlocal scenery, you know?\n- Have you seen the local scenery? - asked the voice of Gargravarr.\n- Er, no.\nZaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one of the\nwrecked buildings that was obscuring his view.\nHe looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B.\n- Ah, OK, - he said, - I\u2019ll just sort of slouch about then.\n- No, - said Gargravarr, - the Vortex is ready for you now.

In which tree they are born, live,\nfall in love, carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life,\nthe futility of death and the importance of birth control, \ufb01ght a few extremely\nminor wars, and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less\naccessible outer branches.\nIn fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are\nhurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other\ntrees might be capable of supporting life at all, or indeed whether the other trees\nare anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts.\nExotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the Galaxy\nwhich is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is why the Total\nPerspective Vortex is as horri\ufb01c as it is.\nFor when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary\nglimpse of the entire unimaginable in\ufb01nity of creation, and somewhere in it a\ntiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says \u201dYou are\nhere.\u201d\nThe grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain. The wind\nwhipped wildly over it.\nVisible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, gathered\nZaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total Perspective Vortex.\nAs he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of terror em-\nanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body. It screamed\nabove the wind and died away.\nZaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium.\n- Hey, what was that? - he muttered voicelessly.\n- A recording, - said Gargravarr, - of the last man who was put in the Vortex.\nIt is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude.\n- Hey, it really sounds bad... - stammered Zaphod, - couldn\u2019t we maybe\nslope o\ufb00 to a party or something for a while, think it over?\n- For all I know, - said Gargravarr\u2019s ethereal voice, - I\u2019m probably at one.\nMy body that is.

Hey ho.\n- What is all this with your body? - said Zaphod, anxious to delay whatever\nit was that was going to happen to him.\n- Well, it\u2019s... it\u2019s busy you know, - said Gargravarr hesitantly.\n- You mean it\u2019s got a mind of its own? - said Zaphod.\nThere was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke again.\n- I have to say, - he replied eventually, - that I \ufb01nd that remark in rather\npoor taste.\nZaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology.\n- No matter, - said Gargravarr, - you weren\u2019t to know.\nThe voice \ufb02uttered unhappily.\n- The truth is, - it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very\nhard to keep it under control, - the truth is that we are currently undergoing a\nperiod of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in divorce.\nThe voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to say. He\nmumbled uncertainly.\n- I think we are probably not very well suited, - said Gargravarr again at\nlength, - we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had\nthe greatest arguments over sex and \ufb01shing. Eventually we tried to combine the\ntwo, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my\nbody refuses to let me in. It won\u2019t even see me...\nHe paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain.\n- It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to inhibit\nit, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right\nup a body\u2019s left nostril, and so we left it. It will probably get custody of my\nforename.\n- Oh... - said Zaphod faintly, - and what\u2019s that?\n- Pizpot, - said the voice, - My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all really\ndoesn\u2019t it?\n- Errr... - said Zaphod sympathetically.\n- And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job, Custodian of the\nTotal Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground of this planet.\nExcept the victims of the Vortex - they don\u2019t really count I\u2019m afraid.\n- Ah...\n- I\u2019ll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?\n- Er...\n- Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet - people, cities shops, a\nnormal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly\nmore shoe shops than one might have thought necessary. And slowly, insidiously,\nthe numbers of these shoe shops were increasing. It\u2019s a well known economic\nphenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there\nwere, the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable\nthey became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to buy\nto keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, until the whole\neconomy of the place passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon,\nand it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than\nshoe shops. Result - collapse, ruin and famine. Most of the population died\nout.

Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you to the\nVortex.\nZaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the\nplain.\n- And you, - he said, - you come from this hellhole pit do you?\n- No no, - said Gargravarr, taken aback, - I come from the Frogstar World\nC. Beautiful place. Wonderful \ufb01shing. I \ufb02it back there in the evenings. Though\nall I can do now is watch. The Total Perspective Vortex is the only thing on\nthis planet with any function. It was built here because no one else wanted it\non their doorstep.\nAt that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered.\n- What can do that to a guy? - he breathed.\n- The Universe, - said Gargravarr simply, - the whole in\ufb01nite Universe. The\nin\ufb01nite suns, the in\ufb01nite distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot\non an invisible dot, in\ufb01nitely small.\n- Hey, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know, - muttered Zaphod trying\nto \ufb02ap the last remnants of his ego.\nGargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till\nthey reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain.\nAs they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small\ndarkened chamber within.\n- Enter, - said Gargravarr.\nZaphod started with fear.\n- Hey, what, now? - he said.\n- Now.\nZaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It was steel-\nlined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man.\n- It... er... it doesn\u2019t look like any kind of Vortex to me, - said Zaphod.\n- It isn\u2019t, - said Gargravarr, - it\u2019s just the elevator. Enter.\nWith in\ufb01nite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of Gargravarr\nbeing in the elevator with him, though the disembodied man was not for the\nmoment speaking.\nThe elevator began its descent.\n- I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this, - muttered Zaphod.\n- There is no right frame of mind, - said Gargravarr sternly.\n- You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate.\n- I don\u2019t. The Vortex does.\nAt the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and Zaphod\nstumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber.\nAt the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large enough for a\nman to stand in.\nIt was that simple.\nIt connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick\nwire.\n- Is that it? - said Zaphod in surprise.\n- That is it.\nDidn\u2019t look too bad, thought Zaphod.\n- And I get in there do I? - said Zaphod.\n- You get in there, - said Gargravarr, - and I\u2019m afraid you must do it now.\n- OK, OK, - said Zaphod.", "4ccf3320-487d-4115-a33c-fe485be2c0cb": "54 CHAPTER 10.\nHe opened the door of the box and stepped in.\nInside the box he waited.\nAfter \ufb01ve seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the\nbox with him.", "1dd31d72-bd45-4621-8aee-04d1b28275ab": "Chapter 11\nThe Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the\nprinciple of extrapolated matter analyses.\nTo explain - since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way\na\ufb00ected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible\nto extrapolate the whole of creation - every sun, every planet, their orbits, their\ncomposition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of\nfairy cake.\nThe man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order\nto annoy his wife.\nTrin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative\nphilosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot.\nAnd she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of\ntime he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety\npins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake.\n- Have some sense of proportion! - she would say, sometimes as often as\nthirty-eight times in a single day.\nAnd so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her.\nAnd into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a\npiece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he\nturned it on she saw in one instant the whole in\ufb01nity of creation and herself in\nrelation to it.\nTo Trin Tragula\u2019s horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to\nhis satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going\nto exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot a\ufb00ord to have is\na sense of proportion.\nThe door of the Vortex swung open.\nFrom his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly.

He had seen the whole Universe stretching to in\ufb01nity around him -\neverything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that\nhe was the most important thing in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing.\nActually being told by a machine is another.\nHe didn\u2019t have time to re\ufb02ect on this matter.\nGargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what\nhad happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing\nso. Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and \ufb01nd somewhere to hide.\nWhat he was going to do he didn\u2019t know, but feeling that he was the most\nimportant person in the Universe gave him the con\ufb01dence to believe that some-\nthing would turn up.\nNothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for opti-\nmism.\nHe ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city.\nHe walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds, the\nholes \ufb01lled with rotting shoes.

Along one side of it - the front it would seem\nsince it faced a wide concreted apron area - were three gigantic doors, maybe\nsixty feet high. The far one of these was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran.\nInside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over everything.\nPart of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall\nhad caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches over the \ufb02oor.\nThrough the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris.\nThe shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, sometimes like\n57", "a4861b27-67d9-4257-bb4e-875d7b457a3e": "58 CHAPTER 12.\neggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split open or falling apart, some\nwere mere skeletons.\nThey were all spacecraft, all derelict.\nZaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing here\nthat remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere vibration of his foot-\nsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself.\nTowards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger than the\nothers, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs. Its outline,\nhowever, seemed unbroken. Zaphod approached it with interest, and as he did\nso, he tripped over an old feedline.\nHe tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was\nstill connected to the ship.\nTo his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming\nslightly.\nHe stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the feedline in his\nhands.\nHe tore o\ufb00 his jacket and threw it aside.

He could only hear a faint, indeterminate noise.\nHe rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the \ufb02oor all about him\nand found a short length of tubing, and a nonbiodegradable plastic cup.

Great to see you big\nboy, how\u2019s the noise? You\u2019re looking great, really very, very fat and unwell.\nAmazing. - He slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it\nseemed to elict no response.

Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?\nThe walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was black, the\nseats - which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was\ndesigned for was supposed to be unmanned - were black, the control panel was\nblack, the instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place were\nblack, the thin tufted nylon \ufb02oor covering was black, and when they had lifted\nup a corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black.\n- Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to di\ufb00erent wave-\nlengths, - o\ufb00ered Trillian.\n- Or didn\u2019t have much imagination, - muttered Arthur.\n- Perhaps, - said Marvin, - he was feeling very depressed.\nIn fact, though they weren\u2019t to know it, the decor had been chosen in honour\nof its owner\u2019s sad, lamented, and tax-deductible condition.\nThe ship gave a particularly sickening lurch.\n- Take it easy, - pleaded Arthur, - you\u2019re making me space sick.\n- Time sick, - said Ford, - we\u2019re plummeting backwards through time.\n- Thank you, - said Arthur, - now I think I really am going to be ill.\n- Go ahead, - said Zaphod, - we could do with a little colour about this place.\n- This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it? snapped Arthur.\nZaphod left the controls for Ford to \ufb01gure out, and lurched over to Arthur.\n- Look, Earthman, - he said angrily, - you\u2019ve got a job to do, right? The\nQuestion to the Ultimate Answer, right?\n- What, that thing? - said Arthur, - I thought we\u2019d forgotten about that.\n- Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it\u2019s worth a lot of money in the right\nquarters. And it\u2019s all locked up in that head thing of yours.\n- Yes but...\n- But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our \ufb01ngers on\nthat we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to ransom, and that\u2019s worth a\nbundle. I owe mine a mint.\nArthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.\n- Alright, - he said, - but where do we start? How should I know? They\nsay the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I supposed to know\nwhat the question is? It could be anything. I mean, what\u2019s six times seven?", "6a5e37db-99f5-4e50-b4eb-56e9c17f21c3": "97\nZaphod looked at him hard for a moment.

Oh never mind. Look, I just don\u2019t know.\nA low voice echoed dully round the cabin.\n- I know, - said Marvin.\nFord called out from the controls he was still \ufb01ghting a losing battle with.\n- Stay out of this Marvin, - he said, - this is organism talk.\n- It\u2019s printed in the Earthman\u2019s brainwave patterns, - continued Marvin, -\nbut I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be very interested in knowing that.\n- You mean, - said Arthur, - you mean you can see into my mind?\n- Yes, - said Marvin.\nArthur stared in astonishment.\n- And?.. - he said.\n- It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small.\n- Ah, - said Arthur, - abuse.\n- Yes, - con\ufb01rmed Marvin.\n- Ah, ignore him, - said Zaphod, - he\u2019s only making it up.\n- Making it up? - said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonish-\nment, - Why should I want to make anything up? Life\u2019s bad enough as it is\nwithout wanting to invent any more of it.\n- Marvin, - said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was still\ncapable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature, - if you knew all\nalong, why then didn\u2019t you tell us?\nMarvin\u2019s head swivelled back to her.\n- You didn\u2019t ask, - he said simply.\n- Well, we\u2019re asking you now, metal man, - said Ford, turning round to look\nat him.\nAt that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the engine\npitch settled down to a gentle hum.\n- Hey, Ford, - said Zaphod, - that sounds good. Have you worked out the\ncontrols of this boat?\n- No, - said Ford, - I just stopped \ufb01ddling with them. I reckon we just go to\nwherever this ship is going and get o\ufb00 it fast.\n- Yeah, right, - said Zaphod.\n- I could tell you weren\u2019t really interested, - murmured Marvin to himself\nand slumped into a corner and switched himself o\ufb00.\n- Trouble is, - said Ford, - that the one instrument in this while ship that is\ngiving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I think it is, and if it\u2019s saying\nwhat I think it\u2019s saying, then we\u2019ve already gone too far back into the past.\nMaybe as much as two million years before our own time.", "9e4fc6cd-ddfa-47c8-a2bf-aed40aad18d7": "98 CHAPTER 20.\nZaphod shrugged.\n- Time is bunk, - he said.\n- I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway, - said Arthur.\n- Me, - said Zaphod.\n- No. Who it really belongs to.\n- Really me, - insisted Zaphod, - look, property is theft, right? Therefore\ntheft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?\n- Tell the ship that, - said Arthur.\nZaphod strode over to the console.\n- Ship, - he said, banging on the panels, - this is your new owner speaking\nto...\nHe got no further. Several things happened at once.\nThe ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real space.\nAll the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the time trip\nnow lit up.\nA large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide\nstarscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them.\nNone of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that Zaphod was\nat the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as\nwere all the others.\nThey were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thuddered\nout of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen.", "aaa4d189-4770-45cb-a38b-504811db65dc": "Chapter 21\nDown on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast Rudlit\nDesert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system.\nThat is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage technicians.\nThey had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area\u2019s giant control ship which hung\nin orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet, and they were\ntesting the sound system from there.

Hal\ufb03nished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of\nabandoned components lay strewn on the \ufb02oor, and the programming panel\nlolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured.\nA junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this ship was\nbeing constructed, had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell\nthey were \ufb01tting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had one\nimportant journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained\nthat the teleport was available at a ten per cent discount and the accountant had\nexplained that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained that it was the\n\ufb01nest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the\naccountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman\nhad explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship and the\naccountant had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door;\nthe foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head and\nthe accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him\nrapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich.

He tossed a coin into\nthe teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With a crackle\nand spit of light, the coin vanished.\n- That much of it works, - said Ford, - however, there is no guidance system.\nA matter transference teleport without guidance programming could put you...\nwell, anywhere.\nThe sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.\n- Who cares, - said Zaphod, - we go where we go.", "fd4f359f-fc00-401f-b1a3-e8be8c861ca5": "103\n- And, - said Ford, - there is no autosystem.

The sun loomed larger and larger.\n- Hey, Marvin kid, - said Zaphod brightly, - how you doing?\n- Very badly I suspect, - muttered Marvin.\nA shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an unexpected\nclimax.\nThe black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into\nthe nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar \ufb02ares licked out from it millions\nof miles into space, thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare\nRiders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of\nthe moment.\nMoments before the \ufb02are light reached Kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked\nalong a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto undetected underground river lying\nfar beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by\nthe eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that \ufb02owed hundreds of feet into\nthe air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface\nin an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again.\nThose - very few - who witnessed the event and survived swear that the\nwhole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile-\nthick pancake, \ufb02ipped itself over and fell back down. At that precise moment\nthe solar radiation from the \ufb02ares \ufb01ltered through the clouds of vaporized water\nand struck the ground.\nA year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with \ufb02owers.\nThe structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered. The\nsun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter,\npleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became\na paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of Kakrafoon had\nbeen cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion.\nA spokesman for Disaster Area - the one who had had all the environmen-\ntalists shot - was later quoted as saying that it had been \u201da good gig\u201d.\nMany people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few sceptical\nscientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that they\nhad discovered faint vestiges of a vast arti\ufb01cially induced Improbability Field\ndrifting in from a nearby region of space.", "18643acc-7fc3-46d0-af8d-cc54b044a034": "104 CHAPTER 21.", "7bb64859-b42b-4c8f-9e6b-0fc68c526d25": "Chapter 22\nArthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he\u2019d had, but never\nanything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was the ultimate\npits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a\ngood solid kick in the head.\nBeing for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping\nthrob he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The trouble with most\nforms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the\nbother. On Earth - when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished\nto make way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars.\nThe disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the\nground where it had been safely hidden out of harm\u2019s way, turning it into tar to\ncover the land with, smoke to \ufb01ll the air with and pouring the rest into the sea,\nall seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from\none place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at had probably\nbecome, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i.e. covered\nwith tar, full of smoke and short of \ufb01sh.\nAnd what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport which\ninvolved tearing you apart atom by atom, \ufb02inging those atoms through the sub-\nether, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting\ntheir \ufb01rst taste of freedom for years had to be bad news.\nMany people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had even\ngone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that used regularly to\nbe chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport\nSystems factory on Happi-Werld III:\nAldebaran\u2019s great, OK,\nAlgol\u2019s pretty neat,\nBetelgeuse\u2019s pretty girls,\nWill knock you o\ufb00 your feet.\nThey\u2019ll do anything you like,\nReal fast and then real slow,\nBut if you have to take me apart to get me there,\nThen I don\u2019t want to go.\nSinging,\nTake me apart, take me apart,\nWhat a way to roam,\nAnd if you have to take me apart to get me there,\nI\u2019d rather stay at home.\n105", "d0d6a7d4-e2a3-4c27-a0c8-d809dea30598": "106 CHAPTER 22.\nSirius is paved with gold\nSo I\u2019ve heard it said\nBy nuts who then go on to say\n\u201dSee Tau before you\u2019re dead.\u201d\nI\u2019ll gladly take the high road\nOr even take the low,\nBut if you have to take me apart to get me there,\nThen I, for one, won\u2019t go.\nSinging,\nTake me apart, take me apart, You must be o\ufb00 your head,\nAnd if you try to take me apart to get me there,\nI\u2019ll stay right here in bed.\nI teleported home one night,\nWith Ron and Sid and Meg,\nRon stole Meggie\u2019s heart away,\nAnd I got Sidney\u2019s leg.\nArthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a\ndull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood up.\n- Can you hear a dull stomping throb? - said Ford Prefect.\nArthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was approaching\nlooking red eyed and pasty.\n- Where are we? - gasped Arthur.\nFord looked around.

The \ufb02oor was of dark green ribbed\nrubber.\nFord moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall.\nIt was several layers deep, yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars.\n- I think we\u2019re in a spaceship of some kind, - he said.\nDown the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.\n- Trillian? - called Arthur nervously, - Zaphod?\nFord shrugged.\n- Nowhere about, - he said, - I\u2019ve looked. They could be anywhere. An\nunprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction. Judging by\nthe way I feel I should think we\u2019ve travelled a very long way indeed.\n- How do you feel?\n- Bad.\n- Do you think they\u2019re...\n- Where they are, how they are, there\u2019s no way we can know and no way we\ncan do anything about it. Do what I do.\n- What?\n- Don\u2019t think about it.\nArthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of\nit, tucked it up and put it away.

The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an\nindeterminate distance. It was the mu\ufb04ed sound of pounding footsteps, and it\nwas noticeably louder.\n- Let\u2019s move, - said Ford sharply. They both moved - in opposite directions.\n- Not that way, - said Ford, - that\u2019s where they\u2019re coming from.\n- No it\u2019s not, - said Arthur, - They\u2019re coming from that way.\n- They\u2019re not, they\u2019re...\nThey both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. They\nboth agreed with each other. They both set o\ufb00 into opposite directions again.\nFear gripped them.\nFrom both directions the noise was getting louder.\nA few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner\nwall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark, immensely long and, as\nthey passed down it, gave them the impression that it was getting colder and\ncolder. Other corridors gave o\ufb00 it to the left and right, each very dark and each\nsubjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.\nThey stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor they\nwent, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.\nThey pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously.\nThe cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them\nbadly. Ford shivered, partly with the cold, but partly with the memory of stories\nhis favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian,\nankle high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships, haunted\nhulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested\nwith demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of incautious travellers\nwho found and entered such ships; stories of... - then Ford remembered the\nbrown hessian wall weave in the \ufb01rst corridor and pulled himself together. How-\never ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought\nto himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasn\u2019t with hessian wall weave.\nHe grasped Arthur by the arm.\n- Back the way we came, - he said \ufb01rmly and they started to retrace their\nsteps.\nA moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest corridor\njunction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly\nin front of them.\nHidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen\noverweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and\nwheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber.\nFord Prefect stared after them.\n- Joggers! - he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down\nthe network of corridors.\n- Joggers? - whispered Arthur Dent.\n- Joggers, - said Ford prefect with a shrug.\nThe corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was very\nshort, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined it, discovered the opening\nmechanism and pushed it wide.\nThe \ufb01rst thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a co\ufb03n.\nAnd the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things that hit\ntheir eyes were also co\ufb03ns.", "98299c28-6152-468b-8480-11cfdbdaa1ee": "108 CHAPTER 22.", "0de3efb1-d24d-4b2f-9beb-93424005bd5e": "Chapter 23\nThe vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far end, about three\nhundred yards away an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar\nchamber, similarly occupied.\nFord Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the \ufb02oor of the\nvault.\n- Wild, - he said.\n- What\u2019s so great about dead people? - asked Arthur, nervously stepping\ndown after him.\n- Dunno, - said Ford, - Let\u2019s \ufb01nd out shall we?\nOn closer inspection the co\ufb03ns seemed to be more like sarcophagi. They\nstood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white\nmarble, which is almost certainly what it was - something that only appeared to\nbe white marble. The tops were semi-translucent, and through them could dimly\nbe perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants.\nThey were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was\nthey came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be discerned.\nRolling slowly round the \ufb02oor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily\nwhite gas which Arthur at \ufb01rst thought might be there to give the place a little\natmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too\nwere intensely cold to the touch.\nFord suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a corner of his\ntowel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something.\n- Look, there\u2019s a plaque on this one, - he explained to Arthur, - It\u2019s frosted\nover.\nHe rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters. To Arthur\nthey looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever\nit is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford instantly recognized an early\nform of Galactic Eezeereed.\n- It says \u201dGolgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone Sanitizer\nSecond Class\u201d - and a serial number.\n- A telephone sanitizer? - said Arthur, - a dead telephone sanitizer?\n- Best kind.\n- But what\u2019s he doing here?\nFord peered through the top at the \ufb01gure within.\n- Not a lot, - he said, and suddenly \ufb02ashed one of those grins of his which\nalways made people think he\u2019d been overdoing things recently and should try\nto get some rest.\n109", "3863786f-c629-434d-8676-934d4b7d6442": "110 CHAPTER 23.\nHe scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment\u2019s brisk towel work\nand he announced:\n- This one\u2019s a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!\nThe next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an ad-\nvertising account executive; the one after that contained a second-hand car\nsalesman, third class.\nAn inspection hatch let into the \ufb02oor suddenly caught Ford\u2019s attention, and\nhe squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas\nthat threatened to envelope him.\nA thought occurred to Arthur.\n- If these are just co\ufb03ns, - he said, - Why are they kept so cold?\n- Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway, - said Ford tugging the hatchway\nopen. The gas poured down through it. - Why in fact is anyone going to all the\ntrouble and expense of carting \ufb01ve thousand dead bodies through space?\n- Ten thousand, - said Arthur, pointing at the archway through which the\nnext chamber was dimly visible.\nFord stuck his head down through the \ufb02oor hatchway. He looked up again.\n- Fifteen thousand, - he said, - there\u2019s another lot down there.\n- Fifteen million, - said a voice.\n- That\u2019s a lot, - said Ford, - A lot a lot.\n- Turn around slowly, - barked the voice, - and put your hands up. Any\nother move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits.\n- Hello? - said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not\nmaking any other move.\n- Why, - said Arthur Dent, - isn\u2019t anyone ever pleased to see us?\nStanding silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the\nvault was the man who wasn\u2019t pleased to see them. His displeasure was com-\nmunicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by\nthe viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The\ndesigner of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush.\n- Make it evil, - he\u2019d been told. - Make it totally clear that this gun has\na right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the\nwrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort\nof spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a\ngun for hanging over the \ufb01replace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun\nfor going out and making people miserable with.\nFord and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.\nThe man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them. As\nhe came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the\nbuttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would\nhave made an approaching motorist \ufb02ash his lights in annoyance.\nHe gestured at the door.\n- Out, - he said. People who can supply that amount of \ufb01re power don\u2019t\nneed to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the\nwrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the buttons.\nTurning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four oncoming joggers,\nnow showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault.

From where he reclined beneath a wide\ndomed bubble he could see before and above them the vast panorama of stars\nthrough which they were moving - a panorama that had thinned out notica-\nbly during the course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the\nvast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind\nthem which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through\nthe Galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been trav-\nelling for years, at a speed that he couldn\u2019t quite remember at the moment,\nbut he knew it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of\nsomething or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly\nimpressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance behind the ship, looking\nfor something. He did this every few minutes or so, but never found what he\nwas looking for. He didn\u2019t let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had\nbeen very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing\nnobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion.\nHe wasn\u2019t panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was going\nsplendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge. It crept back\ninto his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something. Now what\nwas all that about? A slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ship\u2019s \ufb01rst\no\ufb03cer was still standing nearby.\nNice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd spot of\ndi\ufb03culty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good o\ufb03cer material for all that.\nThe Captain wasn\u2019t a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to\ndo up his shoe laces, however long it took him. Not like that ghastly Number\nTwo, strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports\nevery hour: \u201dShip\u2019s still moving, Captain.\u201d \u201dStill on course, Captain.\u201d \u201dOxygen\nlevels still being maintained, Captain.\u201d \u201dGive it a miss,\u201d was the Captain\u2019s vote.\nAh yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at\nNumber One.\n- Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having found some\nprisoners...\nThe Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he\n113", "b817b487-a126-4cfe-bb62-0356d116a134": "114 CHAPTER 24.\nwasn\u2019t one to stand in his o\ufb03cers\u2019 way.\n- Well, perhaps that\u2019ll keep him happy for a bit, - he said, - He\u2019s always\nwanted some.\nFord Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship\u2019s apparently\nendless corridors. Number Two marched behind them barking the occasional\norder about not making any false moves or trying any funny stu\ufb00. They seemed\nto have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally\nthey reached a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at\nit.\nThey entered.\nTo the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable thing\nabout the ship\u2019s bridge was not the \ufb01fty foot diameter hemispherical dome\nwhich covered it, and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down\non them: to people who have eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe,\nsuch wonders are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments\nthat crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur this was\nexactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to Ford it\nlooked thoroughly antiquated: it con\ufb01rmed his suspicions that Disaster Area\u2019s\nstuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years before\ntheir own time.\nNo, the thing that really caught them o\ufb00 balance was the bath.\nThe bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and\nwas of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum\nof Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out\nin gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the\ntaps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.\nAs the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and\nit was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that Number Two\napproached it.\n- Captain, sir! - he shouted through clenched teeth - a di\ufb03cult trick but\nhe\u2019d had years during which to perfect it.\nA large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim\nof the monstrous bath.\n- Ah, hello, Number Two, - said the Captain, waving a cheery sponge, -\nhaving a nice day?\nNumber Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.\n- I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, sir! - he\nyapped.\nFord and Arthur coughed in confusion.\n- Er... hello, - they said.\nThe Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found some\nprisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a chap doing\nwhat he\u2019s best at.\n- Oh, hello there, - he said to them, - Excuse me not getting up, having a\nquick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in the fridge Number\none.\n- Certainly sir.\nIt is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much im-\nportance to attach, that something like 85Galaxy, be they primitive or highly\nadvanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N\u2019N-T\u2019N-ix, or", "7a834fce-1c08-4ac0-962e-6ed796e10d8b": "115\njinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic\ntheme.

It exists in total isolation. As far as any\ntheory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right o\ufb00 the graph, and yet it\npersists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists\ngo on about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay\nup late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound\nimportance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time,\ngetting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly\ndivided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend\ntoo many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.\nNumber Two stood before the Captain\u2019s bathtub trembling with frustration.\n- Don\u2019t you want to interrogate the prisoners sir? - he squealed.\nThe Captain peered at him in bemusement.\n- Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that? - he asked.\n- To get information out of them, sir! To \ufb01nd out why they came here!\n- Oh no, no, no, - said the Captain, - I expect they just dropped in for a\nquick jynnan tonnyx, don\u2019t you?\n- But sir, they\u2019re my prisoners! I must interrogate them!\nThe Captain looked at them doubtfully.\n- Oh all right, - he said, - if you must. Ask them what they want to drink.\nA hard cold gleam came into Number Two\u2019s eyes. He advanced slowly on\nFord Prefect and Arthur Dent.\n- All right, you scum, - he growled, - you vermin... - He jabbed Ford with\nthe Kill-O-Zap gun.\n- Steady on, Number Two, - admonished the Captain gently.\n- What do you want to drink!!! - Number Two screamed.\n- Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me, - said Ford, - What about\nyou Arthur?\nArthur blinked.\n- What? Oh, er, yes, - he said.\n- With ice or without? - bellowed Number Two.\n- Oh, with please, - said Ford.\n- Lemon??!!\n- Yes please, - said Ford, - and do you have any of those little biscuits? You\nknow, the cheesy ones?\n- I\u2019m asking the questions!!!! - howled Number Two, his body quaking with\napoplectic fury.\n- Er, Number Two... - said the Captain softly.\n- Sir?!\n- Push o\ufb00, would you, there\u2019s a good chap. I\u2019m trying to have a relaxing\nbath.\nNumber Two\u2019s eyes narrowed and became what are known in the Shouting\nand Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your", "e7a6f43a-18b2-486f-bd31-da0b0f621138": "116 CHAPTER 24.\nopponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having di\ufb03culty\nkeeping awake. Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.\nHe advanced on the captain, his (Number Two\u2019s) mouth a thin hard line.\nAgain, tricky to know why this is understood as \ufb01ghting behaviour. If, whilst\nwandering through the jungle of Traal, you were suddenly to come upon the\nfabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its\nmouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of\nslavering fangs.\n- May I remind you sir, - hissed Number Two at the Captain, - that you\nhave now been in that bath for over three years?! - This \ufb01nal shot delivered,\nNumber Two spun on his heel and stalked o\ufb00 to a corner to practise darting eye\nmovements in the mirror.\nThe Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame smile.\n- Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine, - he said.\nFord slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur lowered his.\nTreading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath pedestal.\nHe patted it.\n- Nice, - he lied.\nHe wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he grinned. It\nwas safe.\n- Er... - he said to the Captain.\n- Yes? - said the Captain.\n- I wonder, - said Ford, - could I ask you actually what your job is in fact?\nA hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round.\nIt was the \ufb01rst o\ufb03cer.\n- Your drinks, - he said.\n- Ah, thank you, - said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx.\nArthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky\nand soda.\n- I mean, I couldn\u2019t help noticing, - said Ford, also taking a sip, - the bodies.\nIn the hold.\n- Bodies? - said the Captain in surprise.\nFord paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for granted, he\nthought. Could it be that the Captain doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s got \ufb01fteen million\ndead bodies on his ship?\nThe Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be playing\nwith a rubber duck.\nFord looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, but\nonly for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move. The \ufb01rst o\ufb03cer was\njust standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly.\n- Bodies? - said the Captain again.\nFord licked his lips.\n- Yes, - he said, - All those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives,\nyou know, down in the hold.\nThe Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed.\n- Oh they\u2019re not dead, - he said, - Good Lord no, no they\u2019re frozen. They\u2019re\ngoing to be revived.\nFord did something he very rarely did. He blinked.\nArthur seemed to come out of a trance.\n- You mean you\u2019ve got a hold full of frozen hairdressers? - he said.", "16dd861a-a2aa-46dc-964e-1a6da9907788": "117\n- Oh yes, - said the Captain, - Millions of them.

We\u2019re the \u201dB\u201d Ark you see. Sorry, could I just ask\nyou to run a bit more hot water for me?\nArthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath.\nThe Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.\n- Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more drinks of\ncourse.\nFord tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the \ufb01rst o\ufb03cer\u2019s tray and\nre\ufb01lled his glass to the top.\n- What, - he said, - is a \u201dB\u201d Ark?\n- This is, - said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around joyfully\nwith the duck.\n- Yes, - said Ford, - but...\n- Well what happened you see was, - said the Captain, - our planet, the\nworld from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed.\n- Doomed?\n- Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let\u2019s pack the whole population\ninto some giant spaceships and go and settle on another planet.\nHaving told this much of his story, he settled back with a satis\ufb01ed grunt.\n- You mean a less doomed one? - promoted Arthur.\n- What did you say dear fellow?\n- A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on.\n- Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, you see,\nthree Arks in Space, and... I\u2019m not boring you am I?\n- No, no, - said Ford \ufb01rmly, - it\u2019s fascinating.\n- You know it\u2019s delightful, - re\ufb02ected the Captain, - to have someone else to\ntalk to for a change.\nNumber Two\u2019s eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled\nback on the mirror, like a pair of \ufb02ies brie\ufb02y distracted from their favourite prey\nof months old meat.\n- Trouble with a long journey like this, - continued the Captain, - is that you\nend up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring because half the\ntime you know what you\u2019re going to say next.\n- Only half the time? - asked Arthur in surprise.\nThe Captain thought for a moment.\n- Yes, about half I\u2019d say. Anyway - where\u2019s the soap? - He \ufb01shed around\nand found it.\n- Yes, so anyway, - he resumed, - the idea was that into the \ufb01rst ship, the\n\u201dA\u201d ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you\nknow, all the achievers; and into the third, or \u201dC\u201d ship, would go all the people\nwho did the actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the\n\u201dB\u201d ship - that\u2019s us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you see.\nHe smiled happily at them.", "98b4046c-8254-4bff-9966-d9c764321483": "118 CHAPTER 24.\n- And we were sent o\ufb00 \ufb01rst, - he concluded, and hummed a little bathing\ntune.\nThe little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one of his\nworld\u2019s most exciting and proli\ufb01c jingle writer (who was currently asleep in hold\nthirty-six some nine hundred yards behind them) covered what would otherwise\nhave been an awkward moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shu\ufb04ed their feet\nand furiously avoided each other\u2019s eyes.\n- Er... - said Arthur after a moment, - what exactly was it that was wrong\nwith your planet then?\n- Oh, it was doomed, as I said, - said the Captain, - Apparently it was going\nto crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was that the moon was going to\ncrash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever\nit was.\n- Oh, - said the \ufb01rst o\ufb03cer suddenly, - I thought it was that the planet was\ngoing to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees.

And the\nother ships, er... they followed on after you did they?\nFor a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his bath\nand gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic\ncentre. He squinted into the inconceivable distance.\n- Ah. Well it\u2019s funny you should say that, - he said and allowed himself\na slight frown at Ford Prefect, \u201dbecause curiously enough we haven\u2019t heard a\npeep out of them since we left \ufb01ve years ago... but they must be behind us\nsomewhere.\nHe peered o\ufb00 into the distance again.\nFord peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.\n- Unless of course, - he said softly, - they were eaten by the goat...\n- Ah yes... - said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice,\n- the goat... - His eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and\ncomputers that lined the bridge. They winked away innocently at him. He\nstared out at the stars, but none of them said a word. He glanced at his \ufb01rst\nand second o\ufb03cers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment.\nHe glanced at Ford Prefect who raised his eyebrows at him.\n- It\u2019s a funny thing you know, - said the Captain at last, - but now that I\nactually come to tell the story to someone else...

This was its\nhistory.\nAnd in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious \ufb01gures\nof all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of Arium. These\nCircling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in\nwait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks\nat them.\nAnd when the travellers cried out, saying why didn\u2019t they go away and\nget on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock-\nthrowing business, they would suddenly stop, and then break into one of the\nseven hundred and ninety-four great Song Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were\nall of extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all fell into\nexactly the same pattern.\nThe \ufb01rst part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the\nCity of Vassilian a party of \ufb01ve sage princes with four horses. The princes, who\nare of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fought giant\nogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful\nmonsters from ravening princesses before \ufb01nally announcing that they have\nachieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished.\nThe second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their\nbickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back.\nAll this lay in the planet\u2019s remote past. It was, however, a descendant of\none of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom\nwhich enabled the people of Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless\nthird of their population. The other two-thirds stayed \ufb01rmly at home and lived\nfull, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent\ndisease contracted from a dirty telephone.\n121", "ca639a69-bef4-4a64-a0b7-872ce1d71f33": "122 CHAPTER 25.", "30604dcf-d88c-4fb0-9161-b98773e65655": "Chapter 26\nThat night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insigni\ufb01cant little green-blue\nplanet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters\nof the unfashionable end of the Western spiral arm of the Galaxy.\nIn the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously but in\nvain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained \ufb02ight path.

Ford had stu\ufb00ed some small rolls into his satchel at Milliways and they\nbreakfasted o\ufb00 those before moving on.\nSo far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck out \ufb01rmly\neastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have\nsome clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going.\nShortly before noon they had their \ufb01rst indication that the world they had\nlanded on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees,\nwatching them. It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they\nwere both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not\nalarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes\nafter that another.\nA minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short.\nBefore them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen\nmen and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford and Arthur. Around\nsome of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a\nramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches.\nFord and Arthur held their breath. The tallest of the men stood a little\nover \ufb01ve feet high, they all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and\nlowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the\nstrangers.\nSeeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them, Ford\n137", "94708f4a-dd60-4bdf-b4cf-930641be929d": "138 CHAPTER 30.\nand Arthur relaxed slightly.\nFor a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side making\nany move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed\nno sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations.\nFor a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.\nAfter two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.\n- Hello, - he said.\nThe women drew their children slightly closer to them.\nThe men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition\nmade it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it was not resented in any\ngreat degree, it was just not welcome.\nOne of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the\ngroup and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward. His\nface was quiet and calm, almost serene.\n- Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh, - he said quietly.\nThis caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving an\ninstantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babel\nFish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only\nreminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn\u2019t seem to be working.\nVague shadows of meaning had \ufb02ickered at the back of his mind, but there was\nnothing he could get any \ufb01rm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as it happens, that\nthese people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language,\nand that the Babel Fish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford,\nwho was in\ufb01nitely more experienced in these matters.\n- I think, - said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, - he\u2019s asking us if we\u2019d\nmind walking on round the edge of the village.\nA moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to con\ufb01rm this.\n- Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug, - continued the\nman-creature.\n- The general gist, - said Ford, - as far as I can make out, is that we are\nwelcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round\nhis village rather than through it it would make them all very happy.\n- So what do we do?\n- I think we make them happy, - said Ford.\nSlowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing. This\nseemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to them very slightly\nand then went about their business.\nFord and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few hundred\nyards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in\ntheir path - berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries,\nand pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.\nSo far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though\nthe trees and bushed were laden with them.\n- Look at it this way, - Ford Prefect had said, - fruit and berries on strange\nplanets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the point at which to\nstart toying with them is when you\u2019re going to die if you don\u2019t. That way you\nstay ahead. The secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food.\nThey looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It looked so\ngood it made them almost dizzy with hunger.\n- Look at it this way, - said Ford, - er...", "f24f0200-0bc6-441e-82ee-6587bac731bd": "139\n- Yes? - said Arthur.\n- I\u2019m trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it,\n- said Ford.\nThe leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which looked\nlike pears. The things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter\nand riper than any Arthur had ever seen, even in ice cream commercials.\n- Why don\u2019t we eat them and think about it afterwards? - he said.\n- Maybe that\u2019s what they want us to do.\n- Alright, look at it this way...\n- Sounds good so far.\n- It\u2019s there for us to eat. Either it\u2019s good or it\u2019s bad, either they want to\nfeed us or to poison us. If it\u2019s poisonous and we don\u2019t eat it they\u2019ll just attack\nus some other way. If we don\u2019t eat, we lose out either way.\n- I like the way you\u2019re thinking, - said Ford, - Now eat one.\nHesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like pears.\n- I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story, - said Ford.\n- Eh?\n- Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?\n- Yes of course I do.\n- Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says\ndo what you like guys, oh, but don\u2019t eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat\nit and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting \u201dGotcha\u201d. It wouldn\u2019t have\nmade any di\ufb00erence if they hadn\u2019t eaten it.\n- Why not?\n- Because if you\u2019re dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality\nwhich likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know\nperfectly well they won\u2019t give up. They\u2019ll get you in the end.\n- What are you talking about?\n- Never mind, eat the fruit.\n- You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden.\n- Eat the fruit.\n- Sounds quite like it too.\nArthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.\n- It\u2019s a pear, - he said.\nA few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect turned\nround and called out.\n- Thank you. Thank you very much, - he called, - you\u2019re very kind.\nThey went on their way.\nFor the next \ufb01fty miles of their journey eastward they kept on \ufb01nding the\noccasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had\na quick glimpse of a native mancreature amongst the trees, they never again\nmade direct contact. They decided they rather liked a race of people who made\nit clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone.\nThe fruit and berries stopped after \ufb01fty miles, because that was where the\nsea started.\nHaving no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea.\nIt was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably\npleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one\nthey had left.", "16cea600-2889-4042-9b8e-3bba220371c4": "140 CHAPTER 30.\nLife was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able\nto cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore\nthem. When the craving for company became too great they would know where\nto \ufb01nd it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans\nwere hundreds of miles behind them.\nNevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic more\noften again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from\nsuch enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had\notherwise continued unbroken.\nOn a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they came to\nanother sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time it was harder going,\nthe climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a streak of masochism in Ford\nPrefect - the increasing di\ufb03culty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of\npurpose that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly.\nTheir journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of\nbreathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow covered peaks ravished\ntheir senses. The cold began to bite into their bones.\nThey wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford Prefect ac-\nquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex-Pralite monks running\na Mind-Sur\ufb01ng resort in the Hills of Hunian.\nThe galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make, because the\nmental control techniques the Order have evolved as a form of devotional disci-\npline are, frankly, sensational - and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the\nOrder just after they have \ufb01nished their devotional training and just before they\ntake their \ufb01nal vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their\nlives.\nFord\u2019s technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and\nsmiling.\nAfter a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from out of the trees\nand watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile at it, his eyes would\nsoften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love, a\nlove which reached out to embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would\ndescend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from\nthis trans\ufb01gured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it\nwas almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and\nbreak its neck.\n- Pheromone control, - he said it was, - you just have to know how to generate\nthe right smell.", "a8157823-49ef-40a7-a4a6-22361213edc1": "Chapter 31\nA few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline which\nswept diagonally before them from the south-west to the north-east, a coastline\nof monumental grandeur: deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords.\nFor two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers,\nawe-struck with beauty.\n- Arthur! - yelled Ford suddenly.\nIt was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high rock\nwatching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories.\n- Arthur! - yelled Ford again.\nArthur looked to where Ford\u2019s voice had come from, carried faintly in the\nwind.\nFord had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there crouching\nby the solid wall of blue ice. He was tense with excitement - his eyes darted up\nto meet Arthur\u2019s.\n- Look, - he said, - look!\nArthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice.\n- Yes, - he said, - it\u2019s a glacier. I\u2019ve already seen it.\n- No, - said Ford, - you\u2019ve looked at it, you haven\u2019t seen it. Look!\nFord was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.\nArthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows.\n- Move back from it, - insisted Ford, - look again.\nArthur moved back and looked again.\n- No, - he said, and shrugged. - What am I supposed to be looking for?\nAnd suddenly he saw it.\n- You see it?\nHe saw it.\nHis mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn\u2019t got anything to\nsay yet and shut it again. His brain then started to contend with the problem of\nwhat his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control\nof the mouth which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw,\nhis brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless\nfashion. For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting\ngo of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in\nthe ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to\nthe ground.\nThe thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of\nshadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface.

It whirled and howled through the trees upsetting\nthe squirrels. A few birds \ufb02ew o\ufb00 in disgust. The noise danced and skittered\nround the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it generally o\ufb00ended.\nThe Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye.\nLittle could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he had got over the loss of\nhis gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months\nago he had begun to \ufb01nd his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been\nscooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this\nhe would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly\nwarm water, it must be said, as they hadn\u2019t yet worked out a way of heating\nit. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties were\nscouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a nice\nleafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection. To those who said that\nthey had a feeling soap wasn\u2019t found in mines, the Captain had ventured to\nsuggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this\npossibility had been reluctantly acknowledged.\nNo, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was that when\nthe hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the\nfullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine\nhad been located and was producing \ufb01ve hundred cakes a day it would be more\npleasant still. It was very important to have things to look forward to.\nWail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, increasing\nthe Captain\u2019s already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment\nnow they might stop. That was something he looked forward to as well.\nWhat else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things: the red\nand gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the peaceful chatter of\nscissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising\ntheir skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming o\ufb00\nthe six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath. The\nonly thing nicer than a phone that didn\u2019t ring all the time (or indeed at all) was\nsix phones that didn\u2019t ring all the time (or indeed at all).\nNicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly as-\nsembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting.\nThe Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The afternoon\ncommittee meetings were his favourite.\nOther eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the edge of the\nclearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from foreign climes.

Hundreds of men and women lounged around,\nchatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time\nof it. Their track suits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had\nimmaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had\nstu\ufb00ed their track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be\nsome form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford\u2019s eyes narrowed. They\ncouldn\u2019t be interested in botany of a sudden could they?\nIn the middle of these speculations the Captain\u2019s voice rose above the hub-\nbub.\n- Alright, - he said, - I\u2019d like to call this meeting to some sort of order if\nthat\u2019s at all possible. Is that alright with everybody? - He smiled genially. - In\na minute. When you\u2019re all ready.\nThe talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the\nbagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of\nhis own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him. If\nthere was any reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.\nA small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one of them\nwas clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing up, clearing his throat\nand then gazing o\ufb00 into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would\nbe with them in a minute.\nThe crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him.\nA moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right dramatic\nmoment to make his entry. The man turned to speak.\nFord dropped down out of the tree.\n- Hi there, - he said.\nThe crowd swivelled round.\n- Ah my dear fellow, - called out the Captain, - Got any matches on you?\nOr a lighter? Anything like that?\n- No, - said Ford, sounding a little de\ufb02ated. It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d prepared.\nHe decided he\u2019d better be a little stronger on the subject.\n- No I haven\u2019t, - he continued, - No matches. Instead I bring you news...\n- Pity, - said the Captain, - We\u2019ve all run out you see. Haven\u2019t had a hot\nbath in weeks.\nFord refused to be headed o\ufb00.\n- I bring you news, - he said, - of a discovery that might interest you.\n- Is it on the agenda? - snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.\nFord smiled a broad country-rock singer smile.\n- Now, come on, - he said.\n- Well I\u2019m sorry, - said the man hu\ufb03ly, - but speaking as a management\nconsultant of many years\u2019 standing, I must insist on the importance of observing\nthe committee structure.\nFord looked round the crowd.\n- He\u2019s mad you know, - he said, - this is a prehistoric planet.\n- Address the chair! - snapped the management consultant. - There isn\u2019t\nchair,\u201d explained Ford, \u201dthere\u2019s only a rock.", "222a2046-5912-4bc5-8855-50dea47bab39": "145\nThe management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation\nnow called for.\n- Well, call it a chair, - he said testily.\n- Why not call it a rock? - asked Ford.\n- You obviously have no conception,\u201d said the management consultant, not\nabandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur, \u201dof modern busi-\nness methods.\n- And you have no conception of where you are, - said Ford.\nA girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.\n- Shut up, you two, - she said, - I want to table a motion.\n- You mean boulder a motion, - tittered a hairdresser.\n- Order, order! - yapped the management consultant.\n- Alright, - said Ford, - let\u2019s see how you are doing. - He plonked himself\ndown on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper.\nThe Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.\n- I would like to call to order, - he said pleasantly, - the \ufb01ve hundred and\nseventy-third meeting of the colonization committee of Fintlewoodlewix...\nTen seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.\n- This is futile, - he exclaimed, - \ufb01ve hundred and seventy-three committee\nmeetings and you haven\u2019t even discovered \ufb01re yet!\n- If you would care, - said the girl with the strident voice, - to examine the\nagenda sheet...\n- Agenda rock, - trilled the hairdresser happily.\n- Thank you, I\u2019ve made that point, - muttered Ford.\n- ... you... will... see... - continued the girl \ufb01rmly, - that we are having a\nreport from the hairdressers\u2019 Fire Development Sub-Committee today.\n- Oh... ah - - said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized\nthe whole Galaxy over as meaning - Er, will next Tuesday do?\n- Alright, - said Ford, rounding on him, - what have you done? What are\nyou going to do? What are your thoughts on \ufb01re development?\n- Well I don\u2019t know, - said the hairdresser, - All they gave me was a couple\nof sticks...\n- So what have you done with them?\nNervously, the hairdresser \ufb01shed in his track suit top and handed over the\nfruits of his labour to Ford.\nFord held them up for all to see.\n- Curling tongs, - he said.\nThe crowd applauded.\n- Never mind, - said Ford, - Rome wasn\u2019t burnt in a day.\nThe crowd hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they\nloved it nevertheless. They applauded.\n- Well, you\u2019re obviously being totally naive of course, - said the girl, - When\nyou\u2019ve been in marketing as long as I have you\u2019ll know that before any new\nproduct can be developed it has to be properly researched. We\u2019ve got to \ufb01nd\nout what people want from \ufb01re, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has\nfor them.\nThe crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford.\n- Stick it up your nose, - he said.\n- Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know, - insisted the girl, -\nDo people want \ufb01re that can be applied nasally?", "dab32793-645b-424c-81bb-00a8dd0b5e5a": "146 CHAPTER 32.\n- Do you? - Ford asked the crowd.\n- Yes! - shouted some.\n- No! - shouted others happily.\nThey didn\u2019t know, they just thought it was great.\n- And the wheel, - said the Captain, - What about this wheel thingy?

Ford\nshrugged his shoulders and sat down again.\n- Almighty Zarquon, - he said, - have none of you done anything?\nAs if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from\nthe entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn\u2019t believe the amount of en-\ntertainment they were getting this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a\ndozen men dressed in the remnants of their Golgafrincham 3rd Regiment dress\nuniforms. About half of them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now car-\nried spears which they struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed,\nhealthy, and utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and\nbanged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again.\n- Captain, sir! - cried Number Two - for he was their leader - - Permission\nto report sir!\n- Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot springs?\n- said the Captain despondently.\n- No sir!\n- Thought you wouldn\u2019t.\nNumber Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath.\n- We have discovered another continent!\n- When was this?\n- It lies across the sea... - said Number Two, narrowing his eyes signi\ufb01cantly,\n- to the east!\n- Ah.\nNumber Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his head.\nThis is going to be great, thought the crowd.\n- We have declared war on it!\nWild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing - this was\nbeyond all expectation.\n- Wait a minute, - shouted Ford Prefect, - wait a minute!\nHe leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, or at least\nthe best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances\nwere that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem.\n- Do we have to have the piper? - demanded Ford.\n- Oh yes, - said the Captain, - we\u2019ve given him a grant.\nFord considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that\nthat way madness lay.

It doesn\u2019t grow on trees you know.\n- If you would allow me to continue...\nFord nodded dejectedly.\n- Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal\ntender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich.\nFord stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at\nthis and greedily \ufb01ngering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were\nstu\ufb00ed.\n- But we have also, - continued the Management Consultant, - run into a\nsmall in\ufb02ation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which\nmeans that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous\nforests buying one ship\u2019s peanut.\nMurmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management Consultant\nwaved them down.\n- So in order to obviate this problem, - he continued, - and e\ufb00ectively reval-\nuate the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and...\ner, burn down all the forests. I think you\u2019ll all agree that\u2019s a sensible move\nunder the circumstances.\nThe crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until\nsomeone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in\ntheir pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the Manage-\nment Consultant a standing ovation.

You and that other interloper have been missing since\nthe day we arrived.\n- We\u2019ve been on a journey, - said Ford, - We went to try and \ufb01nd out\nsomething about this planet.\n- Oh, - said the girl archly, - doesn\u2019t sound very productive to me.\n- No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered this\nplanet\u2019s future.\nFord waited for this statement to have its e\ufb00ect. It didn\u2019t have any. They\ndidn\u2019t know what he was talking about.\nHe continued.\n- It doesn\u2019t matter a pair of fetid dingo\u2019s kidneys what you all choose to\ndo from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it won\u2019t make a scrap of\ndi\ufb00erence. Your future history has already happened. Two million years you\u2019ve\ngot and that\u2019s it. At the end of that time your race will be dead, gone and good\nriddance to you. Remember that, two million years!\nThe crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they had\nsuddenly become shouldn\u2019t be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish. Perhaps\nthey could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away.\nThey didn\u2019t need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the clearing,\npausing only to shake his head at Number Two who was already \ufb01ring his Kill-\nO-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees.\nHe turned back once.\n- Two million years! - he said and laughed.\n- Well, - said the Captain with a soothing smile, - still time for a few more\nbaths.

Sitting morosely round the rock were\na couple of the surviving local native men whom Arthur Dent was trying to\nintroduce the curious concept embodied in these stones.\nSo far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of them,\nbury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had \ufb01nally encouraged one\nof them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which was\nnot even as far as he\u2019d managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid de-\nterioration in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding\ndeterioration in their actual intelligence.\nIn an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters on\nthe board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more\nthemselves.\nIt was not going well.\nFord watched quietly from beside a nearby tree.\n- No, - said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shu\ufb04ed some of the\nletters round in a \ufb01t of abysmal dejection, - Q scores ten you see, and it\u2019s on a\ntriple word score, so... look, I\u2019ve explained the rules to you... no no, look please,\nput down that jawbone... alright, we\u2019ll start again. And try to concentrate this\ntime.\nFord leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his head.\n- What are you doing, Arthur? - he asked quietly.\nArthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all this might\nlook slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him\nwhen he was a chid. But things were di\ufb00erent then, or rather would be.\n- I\u2019m trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble, - he said.\n- They\u2019re not cavemen, - said Ford.\n- They look like cavemen.\nFord let it pass.\n- I see, - he said.\n- It\u2019s uphill work, - said Arthur wearily, - the only word they know is grunt\nand they can\u2019t spell it.\n151", "efeb59bc-2a17-44d4-aeb4-8bfa80aeb661": "152 CHAPTER 33.\nHe sighed and sat back.\n- What\u2019s that supposed to achieve? - asked Ford.\n- We\u2019ve got to encourage them to evolve! To develop! - Arthur burst out\nangrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger might do something\nto counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently\nsu\ufb00ering. It didn\u2019t. He jumped to his feet.\n- Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those... cretins\nwe arrived with? - he said.\n- Imagine? - said Ford, rising his eyebrows. - We don\u2019t have to imagine.\nWe\u2019ve seen it.\n- But... - Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly.\n- We\u2019ve seen it, - said Ford, - there\u2019s no escape.\nArthur kicked at a stone.\n- Did you tell them what we\u2019ve discovered? - he asked.\n- Hmmmm? - said Ford, not really concentrating.\n- Norway, - said Arthur, - Slartibartfast\u2019s signature in the glacier.

Why don\u2019t you tell them that? Go and say\nto them, \u201dExcuse me, I\u2019d just like to point out that in two million years\u2019 time I\nwill be born just a few miles from here.\u201d See what they say.

He shook his head.\n- Put the Scrabble away, Arthur, - he said, - it won\u2019t save the human race,\nbecause this lot aren\u2019t going to be the human race. The human race is currently\nsitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about\nthemselves.\nArthur winced.\n- There must be something we can do, - he said. A terrible sense of desolation\nthrilled through his body that he should be here, on the Earth, the Earth which\nhad lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed\nset to lose its past as well.\n- No, - said Ford, - there\u2019s nothing we can do. This doesn\u2019t change the\nhistory of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the Earth.

The\nonly moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw\nthe letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is\nunavoidable.\nLike most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was com-\npletely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.

So do you see what this means?\n- What?\n- Cock up, - said Ford Prefect.\nArthur looked around him.\n- This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it, - he said.\nFord puzzled for a moment.\n- Still, something must have come out of it, - he said at last, - because Marvin\nsaid he could see the Question printed in your brain wave patterns.\n- But...\n- Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one.

The letter he put down next to it\nwas an I. That spelt IT. He tossed another couple of letters next to them They\nwere an S and an H as it happened. By a curious coincidence the resulting\nword perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just then. He\nstared at it for a moment. He hadn\u2019t done it deliberately, it was just a random\nchance.
