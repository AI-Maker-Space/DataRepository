0,7 January 2014,Hitchcoc,8," A Mile a Minute
","After reading some of the previous reviews, I wonder what it takes to engage the modern viewer. It seems we have become so jaded that we see the necessity of giving a one star review to something as phenomenal as this film is. It is filled with action, sets of remarkable creativity, amazing characters, in a complex plot that made me long for the conclusion. I know it doesn't follow the book religiously. Get over that. Even a fifteen hour miniseries based on a novel fails miserably. Of course, every English teacher on the planet knows that we are working in two entirely different mediums. Books and movies are different! What Peter Jackson has done is taken the primary plot and allowed his script writers to take what is given and supplement it with their own creativity. The first film, though imperfect, does set the stage for this superior second effort. What we get is nonstop action, moving the characters toward the object of their quest. Tolkien's rules are followed if not the letter of the plot. The first film was criticized for being too talky. Now this one is being criticized for not being talky enough. For me, the scene where the gang must escape an elven prison and face the orcs is one of the most delightful fifteen minutes I've ever spent in a movie theater. I don't expect an action film based on a book with voluminous characters to have character development like ""Driving Miss Daisy."" See the film for what it is and count yourselves lucky to have the luxury of being able to see the amazing accomplishments of the Peter Jackson's of the world.",/review/rw2937193/?ref_=tt_urv
1,28 December 2013,bob the moo,," Improves upon the first one just about enough to cover the weaknesses it shares with it
","After seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a ""12 months earlier"" scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn't that the first film was bad (it is too expensive to be bad) but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me, really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in (and I say this as a gamer). I didn't hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and, as Theo Robertson has said, perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.",/review/rw2930071/?ref_=tt_urv
2,3 January 2015,Quinoa1984,6," Smaug rules, and the rest of the movie... is okay (thought I'd say 'drools' didn't ya)
","Bilbo is supposedly the lynch-pin of this whole story - hell, it's called 'The Hobbit' after all, and it's about (as the song in the 1977 animated film starts, 'The greeeeatest adventurrrre') - but damn if you'd know it watching the majority of this entry. I say the 'majority' as he does show up in large part at the end, when it comes time to enter the castle in the mountains and the face-off against the dragon, Smaug, who has hoarded over the dwarfs' gold. But with the exception of a few scenes scattered about, it felt like there was a lack of Bilbo, which is a shame since Martin Freeman is so moving and funny and on-point in this role of the quirky 'straight-man' to these much quirkier, rambunctious dwarfs led by who is arguably the real protagonist - or co-protagonist - Thorin Oakensheild.",/review/rw3154641/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having really enjoyed An Unexpected Journey, though it was a long way from perfect, last year, a family cinema outing for this was guaranteed. And it was worth the wait, Dad and I liked it a little less than my brother, sister and godparents(die-hard LOTR and Hobbit fans by the way) but all of us found a lot to enjoy, more so than An Unexpected Journey. Desolation of Smaug also shares imperfections, Azog is still a very one-dimensional villain and doesn't add a lot to the story(Bolg is no better either actually); the love triangle felt forced and shoe-horned in for the sake of it, including a bit that is like an inferior copy of Arwen and Arogorn; Beorn is criminally underused and any signs of development with him is rushed; the Mirkwood scene is far too short though the atmosphere was good; Gandalf deserved more to do with only his encounter with Sauron and perhaps the beginning really standing out for him; and the ending is very abrupt with a pointless, too long and really overly-silly battle between Smaug and the dwarfs(Smaug's final line was incredibly chilling though!).",/review/rw2925610/?ref_=tt_urv

8,11 December 2013,helge-fauskanger,7," The word you're looking for is ""reimagining""
","I won't ""review"" the content of the movie in any detail, but provide some thoughts about how this film should be approached. I consider myself a Tolkienist (in fact I saw this movie on opening night because I secured a promotion deal with the local cinema: I spent four hours until midnight writing people's names in Elvish writing!) It is to be expected that many fans of of the original book will perceive this movie as a bloated, garbled monster version of the written story they loved. It is important to realize, before going in, that this is not simply ""the movie of the book"". This is Jackson's The Hobbit, not Tolkien's, and they are best appreciated as independent works. They represent different media, come from different centuries, and have partly different target audiences. The children's book was written before Tolkien had any idea of the grand trilogy to follow; Jackson had already produced his Lord of the Rings trilogy and somewhat understandably tries to make the prequels resemble it, in tone and scope.",/review/rw2920368/?ref_=tt_urv

","When we finally get to meet the magnificent dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, at the climax of Peter Jackson's second instalment of his The Hobbit trilogy, we find him curled up beneath an enormous stash of gold coins and jewels, blissfully in the land of nod. After sitting through over two hours of this slog of a film, it's precisely where I wished I was. The Desolation of Smaug is yet further evidence that 9 hours worth of movies is not needed for Tolkien's delightful - and slim - novel. It feels like - to quote Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins from The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) - thin, like butter scraped over too much bread.",/review/rw2939323/?ref_=tt_urv
10,5 January 2014,Horst_In_Translation,6," Not getting better unfortunately
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is the second of three films depicting Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". It's directed like the Lord of the Rings films and the first hobbit movie by Peter Jackson again and also features many of the actors from the previous movies. I have to say I enjoyed the first Hobbit film quite a bit, so I was certainly eager to see this one. Unfortunately, it left me slightly disappointed. It's not much worse than the first and has certainly a handful interesting sequences, but as a whole somehow I wasn't really wowed. The usual criticism about these films is that the book is simply too small to justify three very long movies and while I have been so far of the opinion that it's actually possible to make three good films, this movie has gotten me closer to really understanding the previously mentioned criticism. Also I wouldn't have minded if Jackson had included simply additional characters or story lines to fill the time or just kept the films below the 100-minute-mark.",/review/rw2936006/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you were thinking about seeing The Desolation of Smaug, do yourself a favor and stay home. It's close to 3 hours of your life you will never get back. The plot has almost nothing to do with the book. There are completely fabricated characters and there is NO character development. In fact, I had to go stand in the hall for a minute because my brother & I were laughing so hard about the fact that the third movie could be 3 hours of the cast members literally destroying copies of The Hobbit and it would probably be a better movie than this. The last 30 minutes are completely made up, insulting to Tolkein, and painful to watch. I would actually pay more than I paid to see the movie to get those 3 hours of my life back. I am at a loss for words at how Peter Jackson did so well with the Lord of The Rings movies and then seemingly had a seizure while holding a pen and decided to call it a script and go with it. I think they thought that bringing back Legolas would help the movie, but in fact they only detracted by going ahead & writing him as a bland character who is now, instead of being primarily an archer, a ninja swordsman of some sort. They also opt to attempt to squeeze in a love story instead of actual events that happened in the book, because dull romance sells. If you love the book as much as I do and have any sort of positive expectations for this film, you will be severely let down.",/review/rw2926277/?ref_=tt_urv

The lighthearted atmosphere from the book, that shone so brightly over the 1st part of the his version of the Hobbit, is no longer here, the strange story lines that were added to tie every thing together so no loose end is left and everyone watching the film knows that Peter Jackson did tell us all there was to know. An exact opposite of Tolkien's original who kept always saying (or implying) that middle earth has much more to it than he could ever cover with his stories. It's a difference in egos that doesn't always work for Jackson. Even though he did create a magnificent fantasy epic. Much darker than the first part, much more action packed very high quality of acting performances by all involved. The sins against the original book aren't as grave as those he committed with his LoTR trilogy, mainly because the Hobbit as I already said is a simpler story that doesn't allow for miss representations of the author's intentions.

The scene is fast, action packed and not particularly exciting. When the scene is finally at an end we are served with some forgettable dialog where the company discusses the danger they are in, accompanied by some dramatic background music. It's a sign of things to come. This is basically how you will spend the next 150 minutes or so: long, drawn out action scene, short futile discussion with dramatic background score, new drawn out action scene.

","I would never normally watch a film of this genre, let alone review it, but I had a soft spot for the LOTR films (and the book of the Hobbit... never liked the LOTR books), and enjoyed the first Hobbit film. Well! This film is a perfect manifestation of why American (and I mean that in terms of the capitalism-inspired film factory rather than the nationality) cinema is risible and pathetic. Here's a list of why: 1) Awful CGI throughout. Not a single shot doesn't look like some sort of teenage boy's x-box wet dream. 2) Terrible, boring dialogue. I neither understood, nor cared about, what the hell anyone was talking about or the apparent ""plot"". 3) The film consists of: dwarfs run to a huge set piece and are besieged by CGI baddies, none of which are remotely original; dwarfs run to another massive set piece (all of which look like some sort of fantasy mini-golf world or look like they've been stolen from earlier films such as Pan's Labyrinth). 4) Pisspoor acting all round. Even Sir Ian is over-acting, probably trying to lend some sort of gravitas to this cash cow. 5) Crap music: couldn't be arsed to come up with anything new? 6) Whatever this new HFR thing is meant to be, it looks AWFUL.

","I think this is the worst movie of LOTR+Hobbit series. I found it very annoying and boring. The talents and the luck of hobbits are greatly exaggerated as if in a smurf or Tom&Jerry cartoon. Well, at the beginning of the movie, there was no flashback of the previous episode so I began to think that this was an independent adventure. As one year passed over the previous Hobbit movie and unless you are a keen JRR fan, there is no way to remember where the last episode ended. There are many ridiculous things in the plot. Why did Gandalf disappear when he was needed most at the entrance of that scary forest? Why did he met with the other nutty sorcerer inside the cave of a mountain? And why did Gandalf told him not to follow him after a short while? How did all those hobbits survived the giant spiders without a scratch? It was an insult to Frodo's legendary fight against the spider in LOTR. What was the fight against that dragon? Come ooooon!!! It was 100 times larger than Balrog and those super witty hobbits succeed to dip it inside a huge 5000 Celsius gold bath again without getting a scratch. And this was an insult to Gandalf's legendary fight against Balrog. During all this time, the scenes were interrupted, the fight against the dragon was interrupted at least 10 times because of the stupid chase in the lake city. I don't even want to mention the fight between the orcs and hobbits along the river and the one between the elf and big orc chief in the lake city in which the orc chief should have cracked all his bones. They all deteriorated the charm of the LOTR trilogy. The director should very well read these comments and pull himself together.

It was boring, overlong and had just too much filler. Tauriel is unnecessary. Read the books - no Elven women fight. This is far too much of a stretch. Then to have a love triangle between two elves and a dwarf? Unacceptable. No elf or dwarf have EVER been lovers or in love. Even when friends, both races were keenly aware of their differences. If Tolkien didn't write it, Jackson shouldn't have included it. Adding stuff from the appendixes was a great idea, but the whole scene was done poorly. And Beorn, a major character, used in a cameo? I was disappointed beyond words in this movie. Overblown and under thought, with a horrible ending (likely because of all the unnecessary filler), this wasn't anything like the great two part film the Hobbit should have been.

But unfortunately the emotions of a Hobbit or the leadership of Thorin don't get much screen time among the action of Elves. Many good moments, characters are initially built and then the movie leaves them and jumbles between 2-3 parallel story arcs. We don't see enough of Bilbo here and the emotional bond between Bilbo and the dwarfs is almost gone. We had many emotional moments related to loss of homeland and fearless leadership of Thorin in the first installment of the trilogy, but the second installment fails to deliver in that aspect, instead there are some good moments depicting the resurrection of the dark powers. This instead of complementing the Hobbit storyline competed against each other and finally left almost nothing for Freeman. Freeman's natural and eloquent depiction of Bilbo is a treat to watch shorty in the final act. And the Smaug is really menacing with his tyrannical but witty personality. On a technical front, this movie being so reliant upon cgi should have invested more in high quality cgi, the cgi looks artificial in some scenes during the light and shade in some scenes related to motion.

","Right off the bat, I am no LOTR aficionado (LOTR would be 'Lord of The Rings' for all of us uninformed novices). I mean I did read the Tolkien books but felt they were only OK. Honestly, this whole yarn is no more than a dated, quasi-exciting fairytale. That being said, I really enjoyed the first Hobbit movie. It was an enjoyable, fun romp introducing Bilbo to his gang of voyagers and to the viewer. Fast paced and good tempo carried the day. Let's face it, this was the beginning. From that point on I knew this was going to be the exciting chronicles of Bilbo and his horde and their encounters with all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures. The first movie was solid (at least I thought it was) and it was primarily about Baggins. I was so stoked for the second (and last) movie to come out. I did not see where a third movie would be warranted or possible. Boy was I ever wrong? One more movie is all that was needed to wrap things up. Really, just one. Sean Connery said it best in 'Hunt for Red October', ""one ping and one ping only."" Alas, after suffering through this time-drag on my life, I decided I will not bother with the third (or fourth, or fifth, or sixth) Hobbit movie(s). There is really nothing left to see. Read the book again – maybe - OK? But this movie, wow, what a horribly disjointed bucket of twaddle. The story line vanished and was replaced by a knotted spindle of fishing line. And it seemed Bilbo (remember – the main character - you know - the guy this whole story was supposed to be about) was relegated to the position of afterthought, while a bunch of scene-steeling elves flew around and ruined the show. The writers might as well have written the little fella out of the story altogether. I mean, could this silly fiasco had been any longer or more more drawn out than what I endured? Could it - really? Oops, yes, another stupid question by me. Of course it could. The answer to this sad dilemma is a resounding yes. Hollywood never passes up an opportunity to fleece moviegoers of hard-earned cash at the drop of a hat. Maybe I am a bit rough (or maybe not?) Chasing that stupid dragon all around was another exhausting 'bit.' And after all of that running and slashing – that stupid fire breathing clown escapes. Well - I am done.

","I am a big fan of LOTR and was looking forward to the Hobbit movies and was really excited about there being three. I didn't care if the story went askew and was fleshed out as the basic story was there. Now having just written a review of the awful UNDER THE DOME, I should point out that I am very critical of a story being dragged out just to fill a time line. However when it is done well the effort is justified. So when the first one came out and it was a wee bit of a disappointment, I was hoping it would get better in the second one and then be truly magnificent by the end of the third. The middle one is always the most difficult and so this proved. It was almost as if there was a change of directors or writers from the first as the movie was totally different from the first in tone. The first was in keeping with the book, light hearted and a pure fantasy. Now in the second part it was a more serious film with none of the songs and humour of the first. If this was the direction the director and writers wanted to go in the first place then why have all that in the first movie and none in the second? I am not a fan of the songs but I do like the humour and there is very little in this second part. If you listen to the directors commentary on the extended edition of AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY he and the writer clear up some of the ""faults"" with the first movie but it will take a lot of explanation as to why they discarded some of the stuff they did in the first movie for a more ""serious"" look and feel to the second part. I am hopeful the third and final part will wrap it all up but at the moment all I took from this second part is that they finally go to where they were heading but then again that is how the first part ended.

","Though I'm willing to give the movies a bit of lee-way in terms of adaptation. No movie based on a book is going to be 100% faithful to it's source material, at least not word-for-word. I quite enjoyed the previous ""Rings"" movies. They were expertly directed by Jackson. He was able to retain the spirit of the piece - and much of it's narrative. Sure, it had it's problems; a little too much CGI in places, some wooden scenes, but overall it was Tolkien's work. With Jackson's second foray into the world of ""Middle-Earth"", many of the problems with translating books to screen have reared their ugly heads. ""The Hobbit"" has been ripe for the big screen treatment for years Sadly, much of what made the ""LOTR"" trilogy charming has been lost in ""The Hobbit"". My first issue lies with Jackson's choice to make a relatively short novel (If a novel it is) into a 3 part, sprawling epic. This worked with ""The Lord of the Rings"" because it was, ultimately, a trilogy. ""LOTR"" is dense with character, story, themes, and back story. ""The Hobbit"" is a much less fleshed out work and is substantially less complicated than it ""sequel"". The books share characters and settings - as Tolkien created a World with a rich history, language, peoples et al. ""The Hobbit"" is more of a traditional fairy-story whereas ""LOTR"" is an epic. There is a LOT of filler in these movies and it feels like filler. What was already a rather threadbare narrative is now stretched to the point of tearing. Characters are ""expanded"" or cameo, dialog and scenes are conjured from inference or behave in a manner not consistent with their character. If Jackson had tightened up the story, dropped some of the ""wink and nudge"" moments, and focused on delivering a solidly told, compelling work more faithful to the spirit of the piece perhaps I would have less of a problem with it.",/review/rw2931006/?ref_=tt_urv

The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and find out how to open the Secret Door which will give them access to the vast hoarde inside along with the Arkenstone that the dwarfs all seek.

","The Desolation of Smaug occasionally entertains, often meanders. It has a pointless prologue (a flashback with people discussing stuff we already know), an equally pointless epilogue (a superfluous set-piece which is only there because the project was stretched over three movies) and a lot of filler between them.

","Peter Jacksons 'The Hobbit' trilogy is really way behind 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy in terms of quality. Firstly its being stretched out as long as 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, which is way too long for such a short book. It misses important points in the book and replaces them with over blown, drawn out action sequences. Way too much use of CGI. The sets look really fake and plastic, like a theme park. The soundtrack is uninspired as well.",/review/rw2938644/?ref_=tt_urv
138,17 September 2014,kevinosborne_99,3," About as bad as one could expect.
","I liked Lord of the Rings. The first two adaptations of The Hobbit are truly dreadful, however. The worst was Smaug, who instead of being a gigantic overawing threat became a cartoon character humbled by snowballs and unable to even injure one little dwarf in half a dozen approaches. That would have been enough to ruin the movie for me, but there was more, some of which other reviewers covered. It seems we must be subject to gymnastic special effects from creatures clearly incapable of them, video game death, and unimaginably odious ""love"" scenes in every movie or Jackson's world is not complete. I hope his day passes, soon, and with it this sort of film making.",/review/rw3087863/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really didn't care for the first installment of the Hobbit so I was hoping that the second would be better....well it wasn't. From the beginning seen (the one that I had to explain to my grandson, seeing as the two characters had already met) to the end so called cliffhanger this was a really poor attempt to make a dramatic movie. I have been saying from the beginning that Jackson bit off more than he could chew trying to stretch this simple book into more than one movie. This middle movie is a perfect example of this stories short coming as a series. It was boring, then there was a battle, then more boredom. The dialog was a rehash and the music. I just couldn't get past the really awful music. Must is supposed to enhance a movie not work against it. I am really not looking forward to the next one. Maybe I'll wait till its on DVD or cable if this keeps up. Going home to watch the good movies.",/review/rw2921527/?ref_=tt_urv
140,17 December 2013,i_ianchev,6," Why, Mr. Jackson?
","Mr. Peter Jackson﻿ , why would you do this to the second movie? It is such a filler that I was almost sure that I'm watching something which is not from the Tolkien universe. As a lifelong fan of these books I have been awaiting every adaptation with huge anticipation. And with The lord of the rings you did such a perfect artwork, that the whole world was (and still is) at your feet. It is a true reconstruction of the whole tale. And even with the first Hobbit film you did a good, inspiring fantasy epic. But everything that you did right with the trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, you did wrong with the second one. I cannot imagine how I would've felt if there wasn't the scene between Smaug and Bilbo. The whole movie would have been pointless if it was bas as well. At least that scene was deserving. Of course that doesn't change the fact that you made up 2/3 of the story and characters from The Desolation of Smaug. Scenes, characters, relations - all out of space and sense. And why? Because the big bosses from the studios implied that they want more movies and money. Because cinema is a tool which can be perverted. But you can't do that to Sir Tolkien's imagination! His works are beyond time, beyond people or wealth. So that is why I would like to ask of you, Mr. Peter Jackson - please do the third one right (you have the materials). If not to us, the fans, you owe it to Tolkien's legacy.",/review/rw2923584/?ref_=tt_urv

142,21 December 2013,beckersjos,8," Not so good
","By far the worst, until now of the series. Bad script, bad acting, bad cgi, .... 13 dwarfs and a hobbit are on a journey, enter the elven forest and not for long they are discovered by the elves....but a whole army of cgi orcs are not, they can advance, surprising elf sentries!!!!! Bilbo is back as the fifth(fourteenth) wheel. As ever distrusted by Thorin. Where is the friendship gone that was there at the end of the first Hobbit journey. The orc mercenary Bolg walks around as if he just crapped his pants.(Way to cgi)It's all just to visible. Makes the film look cheaper. Like the barrel ride downstream. Legolas was older here than in the LOTR films. Serious!!!Morgul tips(blade for Frodo, arrow for Kili) have jet to become as lethal as in the first LOTR film. I was amazed by the sheer number of orcs killed by elves, dwarfs and a hobbit.I was afraid there weren't going to be enough left for the announced war. Was it all bad. No, the ring making you Dr Doolittle was fun. The bear creature was fun in an adventurous way. The becoming of the lidless eye was kind of great. The dragon was fantastic. The dialog between Smaug and Bilbo was great. Ian the Grey was good as ever and managed to carry the overlong scene at Dol Guldur. The be-headings were a funny addition, however useless they seemed.
Edit:
Saw the extended versions so now the story made more sense and so does the film. But still bad cgi,... Gave it a couple of more points. Extended is like with the first LOTR necessary to appreciate this film a bit more.",/review/rw2925868/?ref_=tt_urv

","Definitely more exciting and entertaining than its previous installment that was inevitably burdened with introductions and setting up the base which to my opinion was a little sluggish. With more references to the LOTR storyline, this would appeal better to the fans of the popular trilogy. Shot and released in premium 3D, the number of effects are comparatively very minimal considering we should wear those glasses for its exhaustive runtime. However due to lack of enough interesting characters to root for unlike the LOTR series, the screenplay completely relies on the adventure element which is again a little unsatisfactory having seen similar if not better content already.
