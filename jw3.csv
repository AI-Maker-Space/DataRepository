0,22 September 2019,bob the moo,," Enjoyably choreographed, but the lack of consequence combined with the global scale robs it of urgency and means it outstays its welcome a bit
","It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can't seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).",/review/rw5136960/?ref_=tt_urv
1,21 October 2021,benxrichardson,6," Starting to test the friendship
",I'm a fan of the John Wick films. The action sequences are of the highest order and there is quite a bit that feels unique in each action scene. By half way through JW3I started to long for a plot line or a human relationship. There needs to be more to a movie than just fighting.,/review/rw7466057/?ref_=tt_urv
2,22 December 2019,Calicodreamin,4," JW3 is about 40 min too long
","Undeniably action packed, but my goodness is it pointless! The whole movie is Keanu reeves wandering around New York (then Casablanca, then New York again) while killing people. I enjoy a mindless action thriller, but this is positively brain dead.",/review/rw5342497/?ref_=tt_urv
3,27 May 2019,dannton,6," the fighting scenes get dull after a while
","This franchise has obviously become a parody. It seems that a very high number of the World's population serve the High Table. They're everywhere, behind every corner, but they cannot kill one single man, even if they stab, shoot, throw him from the hotel roof or hit him with a car at full speed. And the Head of this ""powerful organization"" lives among camels in an African desert ... There are some entertaining moments, however the numerous fighting scenes become dull after a while.",/review/rw4892511/?ref_=tt_urv
4,7 July 2019,mgd_m,2," Brainless
","Hollow plot interspersed with the most boring fighting scenes ever. Dozens and dozens of inept villains, who are there just to be shoot. Gone are the fresh sequences of the first movie.
Super-uninteresting main villain. Very poor climax. Twists, just for the sake of twists. It seems like there's nobody out there capable of writing a movie anymore.",/review/rw4982369/?ref_=tt_urv
5,17 July 2019,soundoflight,5," The magic is gone
","The first John Wick film was special because it broke a mold of sorts. It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film. John Wick was cool.",/review/rw4999970/?ref_=tt_urv
6,7 February 2020,BA_Harrison,4," More of the same. Yawn!
","Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.",/review/rw5466367/?ref_=tt_urv
7,18 May 2019,drjgardner,4," Less is more
","About mid-way through the film, after about 100 people had been shot, stabbed, strangled, or otherwise dispatched I started to yawn. Seriously! Is this a film or a video game? On the positive side, it was better than Chapter 2 which is equivalent to being healthier than a leper. Chapter 3 is already advertising Chapter 4 and we can only hope that we'll have stronger characters and a better plot.",/review/rw4862630/?ref_=tt_urv
8,15 May 2019,jtindahouse,8," A brutal non-stop ride
",About 6 months ago I saw a picture of the set of 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' featuring Keanu Reeves on horseback shooting at motorcyclists. It was such a great looking shot that I have been waiting eagerly to see how it looked in the actual film ever since. It did not let me down. The style this film possesses is insane. It is one of the best looking action films I have ever seen.,/review/rw4854687/?ref_=tt_urv
9,15 May 2019,FKDZ,6," Great for Action Movie Fanatics
","Fantastically choreographed action, especially in the first 30 minutes. After that, it drops off a bit in my opinion up until the final sequence.",/review/rw4855764/?ref_=tt_urv
10,17 May 2019,ahmetkozan,9," It's got its own action style!
","This universe, created without any source material, had to develop and expand itself in every new film. The same fiction can not be made for each film. We don't know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.",/review/rw4860412/?ref_=tt_urv
11,1 September 2019,claudio_carvalho,3," Gives the Sensation of Watching a Boring Videogame
","The overrated ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" is an action film that gives the sensation of watching a boring videogame. The plot is only John Wick running and killing the assassins that want the 14 million dollar award for his head. After the initial original deaths, the film becomes tiresome, boring and repetitive. My vote is three.",/review/rw5093352/?ref_=tt_urv
12,20 May 2019,casagrandicooper,1," 1 dimensional boredom
","This films is like watching someone else play a video game, and that someone has put in the immortality cheat. After 15-20 minutes, it's dull, repetitive and then ultimately stupid and lacking in any humanity.",/review/rw4868283/?ref_=tt_urv
13,15 May 2019,themadmovieman,8," Pure, delirious joy in the form of yet another exhilarating thriller
","Following on from two deliriously entertaining, visually gorgeous and blissfully simplistic thrillers, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum keeps up the franchise's unique appeal in stunning fashion. Complete with electrifying action, beautiful cinematography, a pulsating score and a great sense of humour, the film is pretty much as purely joyful as action thrillers get, and proves two hours of brilliant entertainment.",/review/rw4855261/?ref_=tt_urv
14,29 August 2020,Xstal,7," John Dips His Wick into Parabellum...
","Another significant increase in body count contribution, not including the injured and\or maimed, as John inserts his wickedness into the flesh and bones of those whose aim is unworthy of their role in organised crime, either that, or they've never handled a weapon or are visually impaired or only shoot blanks or all three.",/review/rw6042433/?ref_=tt_urv
15,12 July 2019,brummieman,2," John Wick is excommunicado and ...
","...totally over-rated. I enjoyed the first 10 mins and thought it was going to be good, but it quickly became the most irritating film I have seen this year and after just half hour it was hard to watch. In the first 10 mins the story is already set, he is pronounced excommunicado which means he has no access to any help or recourse , he is cut off and a huge bounty is placed on his head, from then on everyone, everywhere knows him and is after the bounty, every road he walks in and every door he walks through he finds about 50 people he needs to kill so it is literally and execution by the second repeated over and over and over and over, and after 1 hour of being irritated so much it was over for me, thankfully, I turned it off",/review/rw4990871/?ref_=tt_urv
16,16 May 2019,Dannyboi94,8," Finally an action franchise than doesn't lose its touch!
","John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.",/review/rw4858493/?ref_=tt_urv
17,19 May 2019,imamdin_rabia,6," Too much action, lacking storyline
","I liked the first two movies, both had a meaning behind all the action that takes place, this movie the plot is weak and the fight scenes way too long for the weak plot. Keanu still portrays his character as the Boogeyman really well, I enjoyed it but just felt it dragged on a bit much and the fight scene especially with Halle could have been cut down.",/review/rw4864652/?ref_=tt_urv
18,19 May 2019,jhr2012,1," Silly
","The first John Wick movie had a story. It had a plot and some character development. This movie has no such thing.
I like an action movie as much as the next guy, but this was way over the top. If you like gun play, endless, goofy, martial arts crap, and broken glass, this movie is for you!
The last fight sequence was downright boring. I found myself wishing that the movie would just end; I didn't care who killed who. In fact, I was kind of hoping it would be Wick so that the movie would end and I could go home. The movie is about 30 minutes too long.
Here's hoping that this is the end of the JW franchise, but I'm sure it won't be. I can guarantee i will not be fooled into purchasing a ticket to JW 4!",/review/rw4863706/?ref_=tt_urv
19,22 September 2019,Leofwine_draca,9," Sheer enjoyment
","The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!",/review/rw5135863/?ref_=tt_urv
20,13 July 2019,janetwilkinson,1," Boring Dull and full of Stereotypes
","Sadly the third John Wick film has deteriorated into a mindless, plotless, overly violent action scene that lasts for 2 hours. Zero plot, typical anti-male female characters, ridiculous levels of gore beyond what is needed. It's a clear indication that either the population is getting dumber that we have so many 10/10 reviews for this movie, or people are being paid to post positive reviews.",/review/rw4993039/?ref_=tt_urv

22,18 May 2019,karmazyn,6," Pure brutal action with shallow, uninteresting story dragging it to the mediocrity.
","Lets contemplate about components of perfect action movie for a moment- What makes action movies special. Is it it's characters, is it ability to create fantastic choreography or maybe new, shiny special effects. Is it sound design or perhaps a good story ? What will elevate action movie to a new heights? What you need to do to create an instant classic? John Wick 3 creators might not have found all the answers but they definitely created something special and unique.",/review/rw4862259/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rating 10/10
I was able to catch an advanced screening of this movie on 13th of may 2019. One words i can say here is 'amazing' yes ... this movie so amazing !! One of the best action movie i ever seen. All the fighting scenes were choreographed wonderfully according to my opinion. Excellent acting performance by Keanu Reeves a.k.a John Wick. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie. You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the fans out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience. Go see it you wont regret it.",/review/rw4854296/?ref_=tt_urv

","John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is quite literally about consequences, dealing with the fallout of John's actions at the end of the previous film and sending him on an even bigger odyssey of violence that continues to explore this world of assassination and deliver beautifully clean action sequences.",/review/rw4860603/?ref_=tt_urv
