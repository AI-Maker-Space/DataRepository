What is the main focus of this paper?, The main focus of this paper is to introduce a new method for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) through retrieval-based instruction-following.,"['Closed-set tasks include two datasets, i.e., a fact verification dataset about public health (PubHealth;\nZhang et al. 2023) and a multiple-choice reasoning dataset created from scientific exams (ARC-\n6\nPreprint.\nChallenge; Clark et al. 2018). We use accuracy as an evaluation metric and report on the test set. We\naggregate the answer probabilities of target classes for both of these datasets (Appendix Section B.2).\nShort-form generations tasks include two open-domain question answering (QA) datasets,\nPopQA (Mallen et al., 2023) and TriviaQA-unfiltered (Joshi et al., 2017), where systems need\nto answer arbitrary questions about factual knowledge. For PopQA, we use the long-tail subset,\nconsisting of 1,399 rare entity queries whose monthly Wikipedia page views are less than 100. As the\nTriviaQA-unfiltered (open) test set is not publicly available, we follow prior work’s validation and\ntest split (Min et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020), using 11,313 test queries for evaluation. We evaluate\nperformance based on whether gold answers are included in the model generations instead of strictly\nrequiring exact matching, following Mallen et al. (2023); Schick et al. (2023).\nLong-form generation tasks include a biography generation task (Min et al., 2023) and a long-form\nQA task ALCE-ASQA Gao et al. (2023); Stelmakh et al. (2022). We use FactScore (Min et al.,\n2023) to evaluate biographies, and we use official metrics of correctness (str-em), fluency based on\nMAUVE (Pillutla et al., 2021), and citation precision and recall (Gao et al., 2023) for ASQA. 5\n4.2\nBASELINES\nBaselines without retrievals.\nWe evaluate strong publicly available pre-trained LLMs,\nLlama27B,13B (Touvron et al., 2023), instruction-tuned models, Alpaca7B,13B (Dubois et al., 2023)\n(our replication based on Llama2); and models trained and reinforced using private data, Chat-\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Llama2-chat13B. For instruction-tuned LMs, we use the official\nsystem prompt or instruction format used during training if publicly available. We also compare our\nmethod to concurrent work, CoVE65B (Dhuliawala et al., 2023), which introduces iterative prompt\nengineering to improve the factuality of LLM generations.\nBaselines with retrievals. We evaluate models augmented with retrieval at test time or during training.\nThe first category includes standard RAG baselines, where an LM (Llama2, Alpaca) generates output\ngiven the query prepended with the top retrieved documents using the same retriever as in our system.\nIt also includes Llama2-FT, where Llama2 is fine-tuned on all training data we use without the\nreflection tokens or retrieved passages. We also report the result of retrieval-augmented baselines\nwith LMs trained with private data: Ret-ChatGPT and Ret-Llama2-chat, which deploy the same\naugmentation technique above, as well as perplexity.ai, an InstructGPT-based production search\nsystem.\nThe second category includes concurrent methods that are trained with retrieved text\npassages, i.e., SAIL (Luo et al., 2023) to instruction-tune an LM on the Alpaca instruction-tuning\ndata with top retrieved documents inserted before instructions, and Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023)\nto pre-train an LM with API calls (e.g., Wikipedia APIs).6\n4.3\nEXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS\nTraining data and settings. Our training data consists of diverse instruction-following input-output\npairs. In particular, we sample instances from Open-Instruct processed data (Wang et al., 2023) and\nknowledge-intensive datasets (Petroni et al., 2021; Stelmakh et al., 2022; Mihaylov et al., 2018). In\ntotal, we use 150k instruction-output pairs. We use Llama2 7B and 13B (Touvron et al., 2023) as\nour generator base LM, and we use Llama2 7B as our base critic LM. For the retriever model R, we\nuse off-the-shelf Contriever-MS MARCO (Izacard et al., 2022a) by default and retrieve up to ten\ndocuments for each input. More training details are in the Appendix Section B.1.'

If the preceding sentence is given, the output should be the sentence that follows\nthose preceding sentences. Your task is to determine whether the information in the output\nsentence can be fully verified by the evidence or if it requires further external verification.\nThere are three cases:\n- If the output sentence can be verified solely with the evidence, then respond with [Continue\nto Use Evidence].\n- If the sentence doesn’t require any factual verification (e.g., a subjective sentence or a\nsentence about common sense), then respond with [No Retrieval].\n- If additional information is needed to verify the output sentence, respond with [Retrieval].\nPlease provide explanations for your judgments.\nInstruction Explain the use of word embeddings in Natural Language Processing.\nPreceding sentences Word embeddings are one of the most powerful tools available for\nNatural Language Processing (NLP). They are mathematical representations of words or\nphrases in a vector space, allowing similarities between words and the context in which they\nare used to be measured.\nEvidence: Word embedding\nWord embedding is the collective name for a set of language modeling and feature learning\ntechniques in natural language processing (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary\nare mapped to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding\nfrom a space with one dimension per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower\ndimension.
