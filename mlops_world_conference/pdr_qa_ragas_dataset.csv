What is the main focus of this paper?," The main focus of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of different types of grounding corpora in improving the performance of a language model (LM) in a specific task. The authors analyze various types of grounding corpora, including those that are readily available and those that need to be customized according to query domains and user needs. They also explore new methods to annotate LM-preferred documents of decoder-only models based on their inherent signals.","['the ethical attitude of the authors.\nReferences\nPayal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Li Deng,\nJianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu, Rangan Majumder,\nAndrew McNamara, Bhaskar Mitra, Tri Nguyen,\net al. 2016.
