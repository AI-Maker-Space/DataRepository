","It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.",/review/rw7469852/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.",/review/rw7468495/?ref_=tt_urv

6,26 October 2021,paulclaassen,6," Started off sensational, but eventually overlong with too much going on for too little happening.
","Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.",/review/rw7483174/?ref_=tt_urv

8,19 October 2021,Pairic,9," A Darker Dune
","Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10.",/review/rw7460615/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have seen many reviewers write that this movies has no ending. That's true. BUT: The ending Denis chose seems perfect to me. There is no cliffhanger, no big question that I needed immediate answers to. This movie is about house Atreides being betrayed and the path this sets Paul on. This path leads him to his new home: Arrakis.",/review/rw7348382/?ref_=tt_urv
10,25 October 2021,Fluke_Skywalker,6," Lacks Spice
","More so than even 'Lord of the Rings', Frank Herbert's 'Dune' is an extremely difficult story to translate to film. All of the novel's many, many moving parts require the kind of explanation that just isn't possible in the format. Therefore you have to find a kind of cinematic shorthand the way David Lynch did with his polarizing 1984 adaptation. Or else you go w/a mini-series, which allows for a greater runtime ala the SyFy network's 2000 attempt. Here the solution was to cut the novel essentially in half. Unfortunately that creates an entirely different problem. Half a story simply isn't satisfying.",/review/rw7481163/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's such a shame when brilliant directors like Denis Villeneuve start being given massive budgets to make films and start relying on that rather than good story-telling. The same thing has happened to Christopher Nolan. These guys started their careers turning nothing into pure genius.

15,29 October 2021,zardoz-13,10," Villeneuve's Greatest Sci-Fi Film
","Watching director Denis Villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel ""Dune"" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch's critically reviled ""Dune"" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before ""Dune"" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, ""Dune"" never degenerates into a juvenile ""Buck Rogers"" space opera. ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timothée Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, ""Dune"" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.",/review/rw7492940/?ref_=tt_urv
16,22 October 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This is an all-time great science fiction movie
","Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see.

Not the plot, not the story, not the action, not the Suspense. So slow didn't even care towards the second half. What a huge disappointment after so much hype around it. Waste of time. The over dramatic seriousness of the characters made it even worst. The movie was boring, dragging and had too many unnecessary scenes that didn't contribute to overall plot of the story, they should've just made it a TV Series instead. Nowhere near as gritty or screwed up as 1984 original cat milk. Fun fact there are 3 versions of Momoa in movie. Long beard, short beard and no-beard. The movie More like long close-up shots of people's face while they're thinking, everybody talking Shakespearean, overemotional & overlong scenes of people doing NOTHING.

","I am generally very critical of movies based on books, and definitely did not like Villeneuve's Arrival at all. In this case, as has been said frequently, it is a tad slow paced, but the cinematics, the cgi, is flawless. So many takes are works of art, it is a beautiful movie, there is no doubt about that. The plot does stick mostly to the books, it is enough and sufficient for it to be called Dune, not for example what has sadly happened to The Foundation. This is a take on Dune, there is no doubt about it, but it is a subdued take in terms of plot and the strangenesses (new word) the book has. There are a few missed opportunities, with the Harkonnen, the Sardaukar, Navigators, etc. By this I mean that although the uniforms, the visuals etc. Are amazing, the 1984 movie was much more weird and intense in terms of portraying a foreign or future universe. This is much more mainstream, the plot could take place in any average sci fi world filmed before. As amazingly grandiose as it is, it lacks Duneness (new word again), I would have hoped for a bit more spice in the movie.",/review/rw7457203/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dune is technically perfect: direction, cinematography, score, acting, visual effects.

Even the audio is important with a inspired score and great sounds in general and the big speakers of a theatre can contribute to a even better immersion. Dune is technically great as I said and it should be viewed but its ""part one"" nature is what could let down some viewers or maybe, as it has happened to me, not to fully appreciate the movie. In particular the protagonist has his arc and some important things happen but the movie does not tell a complete story and the ending seems more like the finale of a episode of a tv show rather than one of a movie and I'm already anxiously waiting for the sequel.

55,18 September 2021,residentgrigo,9," A near masterpiece with major missing pieces
","I, first of all, applaud Legendary for allowing the director to do his thing on a budget of 165 million. No fan of the book can be disappointed by the end result but I don´t know if the general audience will see eye to eye as Villeneuve stuck too close to details that matter to him while leaving his audience and even the overall book behind. Dune 2021 is the best adaptation yet but too much of the plot and players were skipped to focus on Paul & Jessica who are the real film. The end result is an accurate depiction of their journey in the world of Herbert but it's debatable if his world & story are fully on-screen. Only Atreides characters are allowed any significant screen time and even their hereditary enemies the Harkonnen are reduced to bit parts. The grandiose and lived-in world is a sight to behold but we see so little of it and are explained even less so viewers might be confused why the film´s technology is so functional and basic. A was especially perplexed by how bare-bones the explanation of the spice is. It is the whole reason for the plot! No guild navigators or space-folding are seen on screen for example. The effects, costumes, score and performances leave little to be desired. The dialogue is easy to follow even if the context is often missing but some iconic book quotes are left behind. It is possible to view this film as your basic hero's journey narrative if one wants to. The way Herbert inverts and criticizes such tales is also all on-screen even if the fruits of these details will only ripen in the second half and hopefully movie 3. Aka Dune Messiah. Our director stated it as his current end goal.",/review/rw7356514/?ref_=tt_urv

","Is it a good, fun and visual stunning movie? YES, without doubt. This is by any means a slow burning sci-fi opera with one of the most beautiful cinematography in history. Is it a masterpiece? NO, absolutely not. I'm a huge Villeneuve fan. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the most underrated movies in years in my opinion. The atmosphere he created there almost was perfection in it's finest form. Somehow he tried to do something similar in this movie, and it just didn't work out for the best. Visuals are important and are decisive factor for the atmosphere in the movie. Villeneuve does this as none other. You will be flabbergasted at many occasions. This in combination with the sound mixing and music by Zimmer really works out well. I love how he captured the somewhat religious vibe in the costumes and decor. Not many movie directors are able to let you believe this world could very well exist. The architectural minimalist approach of the decors really help to get you into the story. And here is where Villeneuve gets it wrong. Somehow the story never really gets launched. Mainly to do with too many bleak characters who are not able to carry the story. This results in a visual stunning sci fi opera with not too many story. And the little story you get is just too little. If you have not read the book you will leave the theaters with the feeling still not knowing what it was all about after 1 1/2 hours. The main problem was that Villeneuve couldn't decide where to end part one, resulting in a messy plot that wasn't a plot.",/review/rw7346182/?ref_=tt_urv

To someone watching the film with no knowledge of the books I think it would have been most confusing. My main complaint was the actors' diction. They all seemed to mumble and unfortunately the edition I watched had no subtitles. Parts of the book were left out and the whole film did not run smoothly. It is a huge book and I understand the need to split it into two parts, but surely if they are doing this they could at least keep in some of the more important parts.

","Finally, a Dune worthy of Herbert's vision. Like Blade Runner 2049, it took me until the following day to fully digest the assault on the senses. The difference this time around, is that it reminds me of certain Euro art films from the 70s where there would be long close-ups of expressionless faces. Perhaps Villeneuve was inspired by Jodorowsky's Dune in the 70s that was never made, that was supposed to have Pink Floyd composing the soundtrack? Otherwise, it is very dark and brooding like Blade Runner 2049, and very much like the book and the mini-series (script-wise), but nothing like the 80s movie. Jessica is a little more vulnerable compared to her 'regalness' in the novel - at least, that's how I remember her from my reading the trilogy three times. And one person has changed gender! Dr. Liet-Kynes is now played by a woman. Regardless of gender, Max Von Sydow in the 80s film stands above the rest, because it is Max Von Sydow and his uniquely quircky personality that can give an added dimension to any role.

Hans Zimmer's score combined with fantastic art direction, and beautiful cinematography, all work intandem with Villeneuve vision as a director, to make this ambitious film worth the long wait, and a must-see in the biggest screen possible. The performances are all around great, although Rebecca Ferguson is the MVP. Timothée Chalamet acts like a sad emo for most of the film, but I suppose that's what's asked of him in the role. I don't agree with anyone who says the film is dull, but I suppose I am a sucker for the palace intruge part and all the politics, betrayal, and backstabbing, so the film having more drama and less action is fine by me. This is half a film (it says Dune-part 1 at the top of the film), so expecting a story that wraps up by the end of one film, is just as silly as being angry at ""Fellowship of The Ring"" ending with Frudo and Sam at the top of the that mountain looking at Mount Doom.

The movie is almost perfect, it however begs for a Part Two in order to see the rest of the story and themes brought to their conclusion.

They felt either so sad or threatening. By all it´s epic scale it´s the cast with peak performances throughout who carry the / their story with dignity and heart. Timothée Chalamet surprised me in ""Call Me By Your Name"" but here he carries landscapes of emotions with the tiniest of facial movements in an even more sophisticated way.

This remake, a bloated exercise in special effects, dispenses entirely with the weirdness in favor of a dry screen recreation of Herbert's turgid story of court intrigue on a planet far, far away, yet still populated by human beings. Add in a typically leaden Hans Zimmer score and you have one of the most overrated films of all time: even Oscar Isaac is left at the mercy of Denis Villeneuve's horrific dialogue.

Being the classic story that it is, I don't think I need to go into detail about the plot. Villeneuve has succeded tremendously in the worldbuilding of this movie. It sets up the plot and the world it takes place in perfectly, and shows us hints of traditions and cultures at the same time. This all makes the universe feel much more believable. All that is set up leads to epic confrontations, only strengthened by the amazing acting of all cast members and by Hans Zimmer's epic score.

","Review of ""DUNE"". Part One. Newest blockbuster of director Denis Villeneuve (from ""Bladerunner 2049, Sicario, Arrival, Incendies""etc). And what a successful attempt to bring the book alive on screen. It's magical, mystical and mysterious throughout every scene. The music is an important participant in creating the right atmosphere for the viewer to understand the time and the circumstances. And music director Hans Zimmer has delivered plenty. The year is 10191, people are living on all kinds of planets. However, human greed has not changed after so many centuries, still no healthy evolution there. The hunger for power, colonialism and superstition is still part of the world. Daily life has blessings and challenges. The struggle to hold on to good values in ethics is real. As always the game between good and bad is started with planning, with a little seed and a lot of hope. There are several stories, all part of the big one, intertwined in brutal action, philosophical conversations and fearful experiences. Some have to die, to save others, for the greater good. Some have to be born to lead the way, for who? Are they fanatics, are they truthful or is this just some insane human interaction of trying to become Gods/Godesses? Villeneuve has thrown quite some questions and it's not easy to find answers. What/who is really good, can we question someone's motivation, cause good and bad are never crystle clear. Can prophecies be manufactured by careful planning ? And is the obvious mistake overlooked, the things we can't control. If we take a look at the scenery, the desert itself is an absolute entity that can control, break and devour humans. At the same time it provides ""the spice"", making humans addictive, dependent and always ready for war ! Whoever possesses the spice, will rule the world. It's the major asset in the galaxy that can determine life or death. And still, humans can't find a way to work together and have the best of all that is provided by Nature. This is to me the main plot of the story. Those who join hands , in trust and friendship, can go a long way. They can enlighten others, be a role model and maintain (world)peace. When this doesn't work out it's for a simple reason, ""the level of perception"". Not everyone understands what has to be done or what has to be not done for the greater good. Only a simple reason and explanation: the big ego. That's why Paul Atreides, who is to be the great saviour/hero, is tormented by all the visions and actions. He can foresee the outcome but is never sure that it will really happen this way, because he's still learning about his powers. He's such a good child and student, tries his very best, but understands only half of what is happening in the world. So sometimes he gets devastated with every setback. At such a young age he already has to fight powerful enemies. Will he live up to the prophecy, become the great protector, or will he change the course of his fate and fight his way through all the battles he dreamed of ? Will he find the love of his life, will Love be part of the blessing? When one has so many burdens in life, it's mighty hard to bring back peace and understanding in the world. We'll find out in Part Two ! Villeneuve has really stretched his talents this time, in adaptation, in a high-level storyline, in music, in the amazing casting of the characters (Ferguson, Momoa, Isaac, Brolin, Zendaya, Bardem etc) and in making us feel what Paul feels (despair and hope). Entertainment, multi action-scenes and excellent performances. Must See !!",/review/rw7359868/?ref_=tt_urv

Those two and a half hours flew by in no time and by the end you are hungry for more.

Not just poor, but terrible. Everyone was terrible. The ""special effects"" are certainly unimpressive. Especially considering it's 2021 not 1984.

What Peter Jackson got right with the LOTR movie adaptations this movie gets all wrong. The movie is disjointed and confusing. The only reason I understood was because I read the books. I had to keep explaining the way things should have gone to my husband who was bored halfway through.
