He was feeling the e\ufb00ects of having not said anything to\nanybody for as long as he could remember.\nThe alien creature frowned brie\ufb02y and consulted what appeared to be some\nspecies of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand.\n- Arthur Dent? - it said.\nArthur nodded helplessly.\n- Arthur Philip Dent? - pursued the alien in a kind of e\ufb03cient yap.\n- Er... er... yes... er... er, - con\ufb01rmed Arthur.\n- You\u2019re a jerk, - repeated the alien, - a complete asshole.\n- Er...\nThe creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard\nand turned briskly back towards the ship.\n- Er... - said Arthur desperately, - er...\n- Don\u2019t give me that! - snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, through\nthe hatchway and disappeared into the ship. The ship sealed itself. It started\nto make a low throbbing hum.\n- Er, hey! - shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it.\n- Wait a minute! - he called. - What is this? What? Wait a minute!\nThe ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, and hovered\nbrie\ufb02y. It swept strangely up into the evening sky.

What? Hey, what? Come back here and\nsay that!\nHe jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs\nrasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to hear him or\nspeak to him.\nThe alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the\natmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few\nthings there are in the Universe from each other.\nIts occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its\nsingle seat.

Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of\nserene bastards. He had had his immortality thrust upon him by an unfortunate\naccident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of\nrubber bands.

The merry smiles he used to wear at other\npeople\u2019s funerals began to fade. He began to despise the Universe in general,\nand everyone in it in particular.\nThis was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing which would\ndrive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on forever.

Most of them he would be\ngoing to millions of times over.\nHe imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky\nlike a child\u2019s numbered dots puzzle.

He wrapped his dilapidated dressing\ngown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning.\nThe air was clear and scented, the breeze \ufb02itted lightly through the tall grass\naround his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butter\ufb02ies were\n\ufb02itting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be\nas pleasant as it possibly could.\nIt wasn\u2019t all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so cheery,\nthough. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible\nlonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture,\nand the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth,\nwhich was that he would go mad.\nHe beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper.\nHe chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce\nhis decision.\nHe stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the \ufb01elds and hills.\nTo add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair.

He looked up.\n- I thought you must be dead... - he said simply.\n- So did I for a while, - said Ford, - and then I decided I was a lemon for a\ncouple of weeks. A kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a\ngin and tonic.\nArthur cleared his throat, and then did it again.\n- Where, - he said, - did you?..\n- Find a gin and tonic? - said Ford brightly. - I found a small lake that\nthought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least, I think\nit thought it was a gin and tonic.\n- I may, - he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering\ninto trees, - have been imagining it.\nHe waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that.\n- Carry on, - he said levelly.\n- The point is, you see, - said Ford, - that there is no point in driving yourself\nmad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save\nyour sanity for later.\n- And this is you sane again, is it? - said Arthur. - I ask merely for infor-\nmation.\n- I went to Africa, - said Ford.\n- Yes?\n- Yes.\n- What was that like?\n- And this is your cave is it? - said Ford.\n- Er, yes, - said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years of total\nisolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he could almost cry.\nFord was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person.\n- Very nice, - said Ford, in reference to Arthur\u2019s cave. - You must hate it.\nArthur didn\u2019t bother to reply.\n- Africa was very interesting, - said Ford, - I behaved very oddly there.\nHe gazed thoughtfully into the distance.\n- I took up being cruel to animals, - he said airily. - But only, - he added, -\nas a hobby.\n- Oh yes, - said Arthur, warily.\n- Yes, - Ford assured him. - I won\u2019t disturb you with the details because\nthey would\n- What?\n- Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am singlehandedly\nresponsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later\ncenturies as a gira\ufb00e. And I tried to learn to \ufb02y. Do you believe me?\n- Tell me, - said Arthur.\n- I\u2019ll tell you later. I\u2019ll just mention that the Guide says...\n- The?..\n- Guide. The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?\n- Yes. I remember throwing it in the river.\n- Yes, - said Ford, - but I \ufb01shed it out.\n- You didn\u2019t tell me.\n- I didn\u2019t want you to throw it in again.\n- Fair enough, - admitted Arthur. - It says?\n- What?", "5893719b-aed0-4d4f-b563-f547aea9ae07": "13\n- The Guide says?\n- The Guide says there is an art to \ufb02ying, - said Ford, - or rather a knack.\nThe knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. - He\nsmiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to\nshow the elbows. They were all torn and worn through.\n- I haven\u2019t done very well so far, - he said. He stuck out his hand. - I\u2019m very\nglad to see you again, Arthur, - he added.\nArthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and bewilderment.\n- I haven\u2019t seen anyone for years, - he said, - not anyone. I can hardly even\nremember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I practise you see. I practise\nby talking to... talking to... what are those things people think you\u2019re mad if\nyou talk to? Like George the Third.\n- Kings? - suggested Ford.\n- No, no, - said Arthur. - The things he used to talk to. We\u2019re surrounded\nby them for heaven\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve planted hundreds myself. They all died. Trees!\nI practise by talking to trees. What\u2019s that for?\nFord still had his hand stuck out.

Then he\ngrasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming \ufb02ood of relief. He\nshook it and shook it.\nAfter a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed to the top\nof a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them.\n- What happened to the Golgafrinchans? - asked Ford.\nArthur shrugged.\n- A lot of them didn\u2019t make it through the winter three years ago, - he said,\n- and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set o\ufb00\non a raft. History says that they must have survived...\n- Huh, - said Ford, - well well. - He stuck his hands on his hips and looked\nround again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about Ford a sense of\nenergy and purpose.\n- We\u2019re going, - he said excitedly, and shivered with energy.\n- Where? How? - said Arthur.\n- I don\u2019t know, - said Ford, - but I just feel that the time is right. Things\nare going to happen. We\u2019re on our way.\nHe lowered his voice to a whisper.\n- I have detected, - he said, - disturbances in the wash.\nHe gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the\nwind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy\nfooling around with some leaves a little way o\ufb00.\nArthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he hadn\u2019t quite\ntaken his meaning. Ford repeated it.\n- The wash? - said Arthur.\n- The space-time wash, - said Ford, and as the wind blew brie\ufb02y past at that\nmoment, he bared his teeth into it.\nArthur nodded, and then cleared his throat.\n- Are we talking about, - he asked cautiously, - some sort of Vogon laundro-\nmat, or what are we talking about?\n- Eddies, - said Ford, - in the space-time continuum.", "33f20a6c-0a10-401e-a056-5d0ec0aed882": "14 CHAPTER 1.\n- Ah, - nodded Arthur, - is he? Is he? - He pushed his hands into the pocket\nof his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance.\n- What? - said Ford.\n- Er, who, - said Arthur, - is Eddy, then, exactly?\nFord looked angrily at him.\n- Will you listen? - he snapped.\n- I have been listening, - said Arthur, - but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s helped.\nFord grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to him as\nslowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone\ncompany accounts department.\n- There seem... - he said, - to be some pools... - he said, - of instability... -\nhe said, - in the fabric... - he said...\nArthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where Ford was\nholding it.

They weren\u2019t like this.\nExcept perhaps some of the ones I\u2019ve had with elms which sometimes get a bit\nbogged down.\n- Arthur, - said Ford.\n- Hello? Yes? - said Arthur.\n- Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very, very simple.\n- Ah, well I\u2019m not sure I believe that.\nThey sat down and composed their thoughts.\nFord got out his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was making vague humming\nnoises and a tiny light on it was \ufb02ickering faintly.\n- Flat battery? - said Arthur.\n- No, - said Ford, - there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of space-time,\nan eddy, a pool of instability, and it\u2019s somewhere in our vicinity.\n- Where?\nFord moved the device in a slow lightly bobbing semi-circle. Suddenly the\nlight \ufb02ashed.\n- There! - said Ford, shooting out his arm. - There, behind that sofa!", "03d66f82-f3ca-4b74-a7eb-5dc7655181bc": "15\nArthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisleycovered\nChester\ufb01eld sofa in the \ufb01eld in front of them. He boggled intelligently at it.\nShrewd questions sprang into his mind.\n- Why, - he said, - is there a sofa in that \ufb01eld?\n- I told you! - shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. - Eddies in the space-time\ncontinuum!\n- And this is his sofa, is it? - asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he\nhoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses.\n- Arthur! - shouted Ford at him, - that sofa is there because of the space-\ntime instability I\u2019ve been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to\ngrips with. It\u2019s been washed out of the continuum, it\u2019s space-time jetsam, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter what it is, we\u2019ve got to catch it, it\u2019s our only way out of here!\nHe scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made o\ufb00 across the \ufb01eld.\n- Catch it? - muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that\nthe Chester\ufb01eld was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass.\nWith a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and\nplunged o\ufb00 in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture.\nThey careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instruc-\ntions to each other to head the thing o\ufb00 this way or that way. The sun shone\ndreamily on the swaying grass, tiny \ufb01eld animals scattered crazily in their wake.\nArthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working\nout so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he\nwould go mad, and now he was already chasing a Chester\ufb01eld sofa across the\n\ufb01elds of prehistoric Earth.\nThe sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid\nas the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it\n\ufb02oated like a ghost through others.\nFord and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as\nif following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was. Still they\npursued, still it danced and span, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing\nthe lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it.

The\nblue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the shoulders.\n- Come on, you two, - the shape said, - let\u2019s be having you.\nThese words had an electrifying e\ufb00ect on Arthur. He leapt to his feet like\nan author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glanced at the\npanorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of quite\nterrifying ordinariness.\n- Where did you get this from? - he yelled at the policeman shape.\n- What did you say? - said the startled shape.\n- This is Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, isn\u2019t it? - snapped Arthur. - Where did\nyou \ufb01nd it, how did you get it here?

An alligator, I think, of some description.\n- Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?\n- Apparently not.

He screwed his eyes up in concentration.\n- I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel, - continued Arthur, - it was blue with\nyellow stars on it. This isn\u2019t it.\n- Shhh, - said Ford again.

After a moment\nor two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled\nfrown of concentration, like a leopard that\u2019s not sure whether it\u2019s just seen a\nhalf-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain.\n- This isn\u2019t my bag either, - said Arthur suddenly.\nFord\u2019s spell of concentration was broken. He turned angrily on Arthur.\n- I wasn\u2019t talking about my towel, - said Arthur. - We\u2019ve established that\nthat isn\u2019t mine. It\u2019s just that the bag into which I was putting the towel which\nis not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily similar. Now personally\nI think that that is extremely odd, especially as the bag was one I made myself\non prehistoric Earth. These are also not my stones, - he added, pulling a few\n\ufb02at grey stones out of the bag. - I was making a collection of interesting stones\nand these are clearly very dull ones.\nA roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it\nwas that Ford said in reply to this piece of information. The cricket ball which\nhad excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur\u2019s\nmysterious rabbit-skin bag.\n- Now I would say that that was also a very curious event, - said Arthur,\nrapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground.\n- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s here, - he said to the small boys who immediately clustered\nround him to join in the search, - it probably rolled o\ufb00 somewhere. Over there\nI expect. - He pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would\npush o\ufb00. One of the boys looked at him quizzically.\n- You all right? - said the boy.\n- No, - said Arthur.\n- Then why you got a bone in your beard? - said the boy.\n- I\u2019m training it to like being wherever it\u2019s put. - Arthur prided himself on\nsaying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of thing which would entertain\nand stimulate young minds.\n- Oh, - said the small boy, putting his head to one side and thinking about\nit. - What\u2019s your name?\n- Dent, - said Arthur, - Arthur Dent.\n- You\u2019re a jerk, Dent, - said the boy, - a complete asshole. - The boy looked\npast him at something else, to show that he wasn\u2019t in any particular hurry to run\naway, and then wandered o\ufb00 scratching his nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered", "d2afa7d1-8598-46c2-89c0-89815b6dd2b4": "24 CHAPTER 3.\nthat the Earth was going to be demolished again in two days\u2019 time, and just\nthis once didn\u2019t feel too bad about it.\nPlay resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford continued\nto jump up and down shaking his head and blinking.\n- Something\u2019s on your mind, isn\u2019t it? - said Arthur.\n- I think, - said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now recognized as\none which presaged something utterly unintelligible, - that there\u2019s an SEP over\nthere.\nHe pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one\nin which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one direction, which was towards\nthe sight-screens, and in the other which was at the \ufb01eld of play. He nodded,\nhe shrugged. He shrugged again.\n- A what? - he said.\n- An SEP.\n- An S?..\n- ...EP.\n- And what\u2019s that?\n- Somebody Else\u2019s Problem.\n- Ah, good, - said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that was\nabout, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn\u2019t.\n- Over there, - said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens and looking at\nthe pitch.\n- Where? - said Arthur.\n- There! - said Ford.\n- I see, - said Arthur, who didn\u2019t.\n- You do? - said Ford.\n- What? - said Arthur.\n- Can you see, - said Ford patiently, - the SEP?\n- I thought you said that was somebody else\u2019s problem.\n- That\u2019s right.\nArthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense stupidity.\n- And I want to know, - said Ford, - if you can see it.\n- You do?\n- Yes.\n- What, - said Arthur, - does it look like?\n- Well, how should I know, you fool? - shouted Ford. - If you can see it, you\ntell me.\nArthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples\nwhich was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford. His brain\nlurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took him by the arm.\n- An SEP, - he said, - is something that we can\u2019t see, or don\u2019t see, or our\nbrain doesn\u2019t let us see, because we think that it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.\nThat\u2019s what SEP means. Somebody Else\u2019s Problem. The brain just edits it\nout, it\u2019s like a blind spot. If you look at it directly you won\u2019t see it unless you\nknow precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the\ncorner of your eye.\n- Ah, - said Arthur, - then that\u2019s why...\n- Yes, - said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say.\n- ...you\u2019ve been jumping up and...\n- Yes.", "cac33f13-b8a9-46a9-b8da-759b15888a98": "25\n- ...down, and blinking...\n- Yes.\n- ...and...\n- I think you\u2019ve got the message.\n- I can see it, - said Arthur, - it\u2019s a spaceship.\nFor a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked.\nA roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people were run-\nning, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion. He\nstumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around. Then he glanced\naround again in even greater astonishment.\n- Exciting, isn\u2019t it? - said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in front\nof Arthur\u2019s eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that Arthur\u2019s eyes\nwere wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth wobbled as well.\n- W... w... w... w... - his mouth said.\n- I think your team have just won, - said the apparition.\n- W... w... w... w... - repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble with a\nprod at Ford Prefect\u2019s back. Ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation.\n- You are English, aren\u2019t you? - said the apparition.\n- W... w... w... w... yes - said Arthur.\n- Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The match. It means they retain\nthe Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I\u2019m rather fond of cricket,\nthough I wouldn\u2019t like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that. Oh\ndear no.\nThe apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a mischievous\ngrin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him, creating a\nblinding halo round his head and illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way\nwhich was awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins.\n- Still, - he said, - it\u2019ll all be over in a couple of days, won\u2019t it? Though as I\nsaid to you when we last met, I was very sorry about that. Still, whatever will\nhave been, will have been.\nArthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He prodded Ford\nagain.\n- I thought something terrible had happened, - said Ford, - but it\u2019s just the\nend of the game. We ought to get out. Oh, hello, Slartibartfast, what are you\ndoing here?\n- Oh, pottering, pottering, - said the old man gravely.\n- That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?\n- Patience, patience, - the old man admonished.\n- OK, - said Ford. - It\u2019s just that this planet\u2019s going to be demolished pretty\nsoon.\n- I know that, - said Slartibartfast.\n- And, well, I just wanted to make that point, - said Ford.\n- The point is taken.\nAnd if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch at this\npoint...\n- I do.\n- Then it\u2019s your ship.\n- It is.\n- I suppose. - Ford turned away sharply at this point.\n- Hello, Slartibartfast, - said Arthur at last.", "39a9259f-3ec0-4b28-98aa-57e4545b802e": "26 CHAPTER 3.\n- Hello, Earthman, - said Slartibartfast.\n- After all, - said Ford, - we can only die once.\nThe old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch, with eyes that\nseemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was hap-\npening out there. What was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself\ninto a wide circle round the centre of the pitch. What Slartibartfast saw in it,\nhe alone knew.\nFord was humming something. It was just one note repeated at intervals. He\nwas hoping that somebody would ask him what he was humming, but nobody\ndid. If anybody had asked him he would have said he was humming the \ufb01rst\nline of a Noel Coward song called \u201dMad About the Boy\u201d over and over again. It\nwould then have been pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to\nwhich he would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent,\nhe was omitting the \u201dabout the boy\u201d bit. He was annoyed that nobody asked.\n- It\u2019s just, - he burst out at last, - that if we don\u2019t go soon, we might get\ncaught in the middle of it all again. And there\u2019s nothing that depresses me more\nthan seeing a planet being destroyed. Except possibly still being on it when it\nhappens. Or, - he added in an undertone, - hanging around cricket matches.\n- Patience, - said Slartibartfast again. - Great things are afoot.\n- That\u2019s what you said last time we met, - said Arthur.\n- They were, - said Slartibartfast.\n- Yes, that\u2019s true, - admitted Arthur.\nAll, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some kind. It was\nbeing specially staged for the bene\ufb01t of tv rather than the spectators, and all\nthey could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard\nfrom a nearby radio. Ford was aggressively uninterested.\nHe fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to be presented\nto the Captain of the English team out there on the pitch, fumed when told that\nthis was because they had now won them for the nth time, positively barked\nwith annoyance at the information that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket\nstump, and when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the\ncricket stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to\nsignify the \u201ddeath of English cricket\u201d, he rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep\nbreath, but didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything because the old man wasn\u2019t\nthere. He was marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait,\nhis hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as Moses would\nhave looked if Sinai had been a well-cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually\nrepresented, a \ufb01ery smoking mountain.\n- He said to meet him at his ship, - said Arthur.\n- What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing? - exploded\nFord.\n- Meeting us at his ship in two minutes, - said Arthur with a shrug which\nindicated total abdication of thought. They started o\ufb00 towards it. Strange\nsounds reached their ears. They tried not to listen, but could not help noticing\nthat Slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn\ncontaining the Ashes, as they were, he said, - vitally important for the past,\npresent and future safety of the Galaxy - , and that this was causing wild\nhilarity. They resolved to ignore it.\nWhat happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a hundred\nthousand people saying \u201dwop\u201d, a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to", "475a4640-0e68-4ae5-8264-91c84c2ab3c7": "27\ncreate itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung\nthere with in\ufb01nite menace and a slight hum.\nThen for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to go about their\nnormal business and not mind it just hanging there.\nThen it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather, it opened up and let\nsomething quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven quite extraordinary things.\nThey were robots, white robots.\nWhat was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have\ncome dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but they carried\nwhat appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but they also carried what\nappeared to be cricket balls, and not only that but they wore white ribbing\npads round the lower parts of their legs. These last were extraordinary because\nthey appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized robots to\n\ufb02y down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what\nthey did\n- Hello, - said Arthur, - something seems to be happening.\n- Get to the ship, - shouted Ford. - I don\u2019t want to know, I don\u2019t want to\nsee, I don\u2019t want to hear, - he yelled as he ran, - this is not my planet, I didn\u2019t\nchoose to be here, I don\u2019t want to get involved, just get me out of here, and get\nme to a party, with people I can relate to!\nSmoke and \ufb02ame billowed from the pitch.\n- Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here\ntoday... - burbled a radio happily to itself.\n- What I need, - shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous remarks,\n- is a strong drink and a peer-group. - He continued to run, pausing only for\na moment to grab Arthur\u2019s arm and drag him along with him. Arthur had\nadopted his normal crisis role, which was to stand with his mouth hanging open\nand let it all wash over him.\n- They\u2019re playing cricket, - muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford. - I\nswear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they are doing this, but that\nis what they are doing. They\u2019re not just killing people, they\u2019re sending them\nup, - he shouted, - Ford, they\u2019re sending us up!\nIt would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more\nGalactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels. The\nghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pall of\nsmoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the\ndi\ufb00erence being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever\nit landed. The very \ufb01rst one of these had dispelled Arthur\u2019s initial reaction,\nthat the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine\nmanufacturers.\nAnd then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The eleven white\nrobots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation, and with a few\nlast \ufb02ashes of \ufb02ame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with\nthe noise of a hundred thousand people saying \u201dfoop\u201d, promptly vanished into\nthe thin air out of which it had wopped.\nFor a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of the\ndrifting smoke emerged the pale \ufb01gure of Slartibartfast looking even more like\nMoses because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least\nnow striding across a \ufb01ery and smoking well-mown lawn.", "6d0672c5-3b09-41ae-8619-570e42a04bfe": "28 CHAPTER 3.\nHe stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying \ufb01gures of Arthur Dent\nand Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd which was for\nthe moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction. The crowd was clearly\nthinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be, and\nnot really knowing which way, if any, to turn.\nSlartibartfast was gesturing urgently at Ford and Arthur and shouting at\nthem, as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind\nthe sight-screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past\nit who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time.\n- They\u2019ve garble warble farble! - shouted Slartibartfast in his thin tremulous\nvoice.\n- What did he say? - panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards.\nArthur shook his head.\n- \u201dThey\u2019ve...\u201d something or other, - he said.\n- They\u2019ve table warble farble! - shouted Slartibartfast again.\nFord and Arthur shook their heads at each other.\n- It sounds urgent, - said Arthur. He stopped and shouted.\n- What?\n- They\u2019ve garble warble fashes! - cried Slartibartfast, still waving at them.\n- He says, - said Arthur, - that they\u2019ve taken the Ashes. That is what I think\nhe says. - They ran on.\n- The?.. - said Ford.\n- Ashes, - said Arthur tersely. - The burnt remains of a cricket stump. It\u2019s\na trophy. That... - he was panting, - is... apparently... what they... have come\nand taken. - He shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain\nto settle down lower in his skull.\n- Strange thing to want to tell us, - snapped Ford.\n- Strange thing to take.\n- Strange ship.\nThey had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship was\nwatching the Somebody Else\u2019s Problem \ufb01eld at work. They could now clearly\nsee the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there. It was quite\napparent, however, that nobody else could. This wasn\u2019t because it was actually\ninvisible or anything hyper-impossible like that. The technology involved in\nmaking anything invisible is so in\ufb01nitely complex that nine hundred and ninety-\nnine thousand million, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and\nninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a billion it is\nmuch simpler and more e\ufb00ective just to take the thing away and do without it.\nThe ultra-famous sciento-magician E\ufb00rafax of Wug once bet his life that, given\na year, he could render the great megamountain Magramal entirely invisible.\nHaving spent most of the year jiggling around with immense LuxO-Valves\nand Refracto-Nulli\ufb01ers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he realized, with nine\nhours to go, that he wasn\u2019t going to make it.\nSo, he and his friends, and his friends\u2019 friends, and his friends\u2019 friends\u2019\nfriends, and his friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends, and some rather less good\nfriends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in\nwhat now is widely recognized as being the hardest night\u2019s work in history, and,\nsure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible. E\ufb00rafax\nlost his bet - and therefore his life - simply because some pedantic adjudicating\no\ufb03cial noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal ought to", "c00e4119-42b1-4c39-9dc3-e68b46b44344": "29\nbe he didn\u2019t trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking\nextra moon.\nThe Somebody Else\u2019s Problem \ufb01eld is much simpler and more e\ufb00ective, and\nwhat\u2019s more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery.\nThis is because it relies on people\u2019s natural disposition not to see anything they\ndon\u2019t want to, weren\u2019t expecting, or can\u2019t explain. If E\ufb00rafax had painted the\nmountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else\u2019s Problem \ufb01eld\non it, then people would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it,\nand simply never have noticed that the thing was there.\nAnd this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast\u2019s ship. It wasn\u2019t\npink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems\nand people were simply ignoring it like anything.\nThe most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a\nspaceship with guidance \ufb01ns, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and\na great deal like a small upended Italian bistro.\nFord and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply o\ufb00ended sen-\nsibilities.\n- Yes, I know, - said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point,\nbreathless and agitated, - but there is a reason. Come, we must go. The ancient\nnightmare is come again. Doom confronts us all. We must leave at once.\n- I fancy somewhere sunny, - said Ford.\nFord and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed\nby what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened\nnext outside.\nA spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, descended from\nthe sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth\nballet of technology.\nIt landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall grey-green \ufb01gure marched\nbriskly out and approached the small knot of people who were gathered in the\ncentre of the pitch tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre. It\nmoved people aside with quiet, understated authority, and came at last to a\nman lying in a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any\nEarthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last. The \ufb01gure knelt down quietly\nbeside him.\n- Arthur Philip Deodat? - asked the \ufb01gure.\nThe man, with horri\ufb01ed confusion in eyes, nodded feebly.\n- You\u2019re a no-good dumbo nothing, - whispered the creature. - I thought\nyou should know that before you went.", "8546aeeb-f83d-4b0b-b2b7-9069cd5264eb": "30 CHAPTER 3.", "0c9b6230-6ac6-48a7-bc7d-29beb90d914c": "Chapter 4\nImportant facts from Galactic history, number two:\n(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner\u2019s Book of popular Galactic\nHistory.)\nSince this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, risen and\nfallen, risen and fallen so often that it\u2019s quite tempting to think that life in the\nGalaxy must be\n(a) something akin to seasick - space-sick, time sick, history sick or some\nsuch thing, and\n(b) stupid.\n31", "4dd52052-4143-4d1c-b997-62dff01febe2": "32 CHAPTER 4.", "b2cffb42-d500-4ca6-b9a9-5230a36681af": "Chapter 5\nIt seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them\nthrough.\nIt seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos\nwere streaming through each other.\nIt seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe, and that\nthe wind was him.\nIt seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe and that\nthe Universe was a thought of his.\nIt seemed to the people at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground that another North London\nrestaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, and that this was\nSomebody Else\u2019s Problem.\n- What happened? - whispered Arthur in considerable awe.\n- We took o\ufb00, - said Slartibartfast.\nArthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn\u2019t certain\nwhether he had just got space-sickness or religion.\n- Nice mover, - said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree\nto which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast\u2019s ship had just done, -\nshame about the decor.\nFor a moment or two the old man didn\u2019t reply. He was staring at the instru-\nments with the air of one who is trying to convert fahrenheit to centigrade in\nhis head whilst his house is burning down. Then his brow cleared and he stared\nfor a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a\nbewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them.\nHis lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly his eyes\ndarted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression merely subsided\ninto a steady frown. He looked back up at the screen. He felt his own pulse.\nHis frown deepened for a moment, then he relaxed.\n- It\u2019s a mistake to try and understand mathematics, - he said, - they only\nworry me. What did you say?\n- Decor, - said Ford. - Pity about it.\n- Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe, - said Slartibartfast,\n- there is a reason.\nFord glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking an opti-\nmistic view of things.\nThe interior of the \ufb02ight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, cramped\nand moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to a small Italian bistro had failed\nto end at the hatchway.

Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete.\nThe fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running jump, he\nthought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand, it could not be denied\nthat the way the ship had moved made the Heart of Gold seem like an electric\npram.\nHe swung himself o\ufb00 the couch. He brushed himself down. He looked at\nArthur who was singing quietly to himself. He looked at the screen and recog-\nnized nothing. He looked at Slartibartfast.\n- How far did we just travel? - he said.\n- About... - said Slartibartfast, - about two thirds of the way across the\nGalactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two thirds, I think.\n- It\u2019s a strange thing, - said Arthur quietly, - that the further and faster one\ntravels across the Universe, the more one\u2019s position in it seems to be largely\nimmaterial, and one is \ufb01lled with a profound, or rather emptied of a...\n- Yes, very strange, - said Ford. - Where are we going?\n- We are going, - said Slartibartfast, - to confront an ancient nightmare of\nthe Universe.\n- And where are you going to drop us o\ufb00?\n- I will need your help.\n- Tough.

The\ntriple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six. Some people say her erogenous zones\nstart some four miles from her actual body. Me, I disagree, I say \ufb01ve.\n- A curse, - said Slartibartfast, - which will engulf the Galaxy in \ufb01re and\ndestruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a premature doom.

Yes I know\nwhat it looks like, but it is in fact a complex four-dimensional topographical\nmap of a series of highly complex mathematical functions.\n- It looks like a joke, - said Arthur.\n- I know what it looks like, - said Slartibartfast, and went into it. As he did\nso, Arthur had a sudden vague \ufb02ash of what it might mean, but he refused to\nbelieve it. The Universe could not possibly work like that, he thought, cannot\npossibly.

Most of the really absurd things he could think of had\nalready happened.\nAnd this was one of them.\nIt was a large glass cage, or box - in fact a room.\nIn it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about a dozen chairs,\nof the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth - a grubby, red and white check\ntablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a\nprecise calculated mathematical position.\nAnd on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian meals, hedged about with\nhalf-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly\nby robots.\nIt was all completely arti\ufb01cial. The robot customers were attended by a\nrobot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot maetre d\u2019. The furniture was\narti\ufb01cial, the tablecloth arti\ufb01cial, and each particular piece of food was clearly\ncapable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo sorpreso,\nwithout actually being one.\nAnd all participated in a little dance together - a complex routine involv-\ning the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, credit cards,\nwatches, pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be hovering constantly on\nthe edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere.\nSlartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite\nidly with the maetre d\u2019, whilst one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid\nslowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over\nsome girl.\nSlartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a\nshrewd eye over the menu.

In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment\nof time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive.

Very few\nthings actually get manufactured these days, because in an in\ufb01nitely large Uni-\nverse such as, for instance, the one in which we live, most things one could\npossibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow somewhere.

This is a thing that only live mattresses in\nswamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in more common usage.

Just for the variety, you understand.\nThe mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that the robot\ndearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futile and\nfruitless manner, and with another quiet \ufb02urble he did so.\n- Oh, just over the one-point-\ufb01ve-million mark, just over, - said Marvin airily.\n- Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me.\nThe mattress did.\nMarvin ignored the question, he merely trudged with added emphasis.\n- I gave a speech once, - he said suddenly, and apparently unconnectedly. -\nYou may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is because my\nmind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion\ntimes more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a\nnumber, any number.\n- Er, \ufb01ve, - said the mattress.\n- Wrong, - said Marvin. - You see?\nThe mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the\npresence of a not unremarkable mind.

Water spattered\no\ufb00 it as a thrill glurried across its back.\nIt did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do. Summoning\nevery bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved it up into the air\nand held it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it peered through the mist\nover the reeds at the part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing,\nwithout disappointment, that it was exactly the same as every other part of the\nmarsh. The e\ufb00ort was too much, and it \ufb02odged back into its pool, deluging\nMarvin with smelly mud, moss and weeds.\n- I was a celebrity, - droned the robot sadly, - for a short while on account of\nmy miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death\nin the heart of a blazing sun.

Poor fools.\nIt began to rain a little, a \ufb01ne spray slid through the mist.\n- I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front of me, and hundreds\nof miles behind me, the bridge stretched.\n- Did it glitter? - enthused the mattress.\n- It glittered.\n- Did it span the miles majestically?\n- It spanned the miles majestically.\n- Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist?\n- Yes, - said Marvin. - Do you want to hear this story?", "974629ea-1650-47e0-9d34-b5b07fe09d1a": "45\n- I want to hear your speech, - said the mattress.\n- This is what I said.

The entire thousand-mile-long bridge sponta-\nneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking\neverybody with it.\nThere was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation during\nwhich a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say \u201dwop\u201d and a\nteam of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on\nthe wind in tight military formation. For a sudden violent moment they were\nall there, in the swamp, wrenching Marvin\u2019s false leg o\ufb00, and then they were\ngone again in their ship, which said \u201dfoop\u201d.\n- You see the sort of thing I have to contend with? - said Marvin to the\ngobbering mattress.\nSuddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent\nincident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp.\nHe \ufb02olloped around in astonishment and alarm. He almost lurgled in fear. He\nreared himself to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to see, just more\nreeds.

He\nhadn\u2019t been able to turn o\ufb00 the doors\u2019 courtesy voice circuits.\nThis doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the\nexcitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round,\nand he had been hoping to enter unobserved.\nHe leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words\nwhich his other head was quite shocked to hear.\nHe peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that in the\ndarkness of the corridor he could just about make out the Sensor Field which", "f1118e38-4c72-40a8-9bda-156b615d8caa": "57\nextended out into the corridor and told the door when there was someone there\nfor whom it must open and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark.\nHe pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself towards the\ndoor, \ufb02attening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against\nthe very, very dim perimeter of the \ufb01eld.

Zaphod slipped quietly through. The door closed\nquietly behind him.\n- Is that the way you like it, Mr Beeblebrox? - said the door out loud.\n- I want you to imagine, - said Zaphod to the group of white robots who\nswung round to stare at him at that point, - that I have an extremely powerful\nKill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand.\nThere was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots regarded him\nwith hideously dead eyes. They stood very still. There was something intensely\nmacabre about their appearance, especially to Zaphod who had never seen one\nbefore or even known anything about them. The Krikkit Wars belonged to the\nancient past of the Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history\nlessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle\nnext to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this\nplot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an\nentirely di\ufb00erent set of ideas which had then resulted in it being scrapped and\nsent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl\nwho had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with\nthe result (a) that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a\nperiod of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at\nthis moment.\nHe stared at them in shock.\nIt was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white bodies\nseemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. From their hideously\ndead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated product\nof a mind that wanted simply to kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear.\nThey had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had forced a\npassage through some of the vital innards of the ship.

And\nwhen it spoke, what it said seemed to bear this impression out. Before going on\nto what it actually said, it is worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the\n\ufb01rst living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over\nten billion years. If he had paid more attention to his ancient history lessons and\nless to his organic being, he might have been more impressed by this honour.\nThe robot\u2019s voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It had almost a\ncultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it was.\nIt said:\n- You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand.\nZaphod didn\u2019t know what it meant for a moment, but then he glanced down\nat his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a\nwall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was.\n- Yeah, - he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, - well, I\nwouldn\u2019t want to overtax your imagination, robot. - For a while nobody said\nanything, and Zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make\nconversation, and that it was up to him.\n- I can\u2019t help noticing that you have parked your ship, - he said with a nod\nof one of his heads in the appropriate direction, - through mine.\nThere was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper dimen-\nsional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship precisely where they\nwanted it to be, which meant that it was simply locked through the Heart of\nGold as if they were nothing more than two combs.\nAgain, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the conver-\nsation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of\nquestions.\n- ...haven\u2019t you? - he added.\n- Yes, - replied the robot.\n- Er, OK, - said Zaphod. - So what are you cats doing here?\nSilence.\n- Robots, - said Zaphod, - what are you robots doing here?\n- We have come, - rasped the robot, - for the Gold of the Bail.\nZaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration.

The sky was dark and empty.\nThe only light was coming from the nearby town, from which pleasant convivial\nsounds were drifting quietly on the breeze. They stood beneath a tree from\nwhich heady fragrances wafted around them. Arthur squatted and felt the\nInformational Illusion of the soil and the grass. He ran it through his \ufb01ngers.\nThe soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass strong. It was hard to avoid the\nimpression that this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects.\nThe sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to cast a\ncertain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape. Still, he\nsupposed, it\u2019s a question of what you\u2019re used to.\nHe felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was quietly\ndirecting his attention to something down the other side of the hill. He looked\nand could just see some faint lights dancing and waving, and moving slowly in\ntheir direction.\nAs they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the dim lights\nand noises resolved themselves into a small group of people who were walking\nhome across the hill towards the town.\nThey walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging lanterns\nwhich made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass, chattering\ncontentedly, and actually singing a song about how terribly nice everything was,\nhow happy they were, how much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how\npleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children, with a lilting\nchorus to the e\ufb00ect that the \ufb02owers were smelling particularly nice at this time\nof year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so much.\nArthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his feet up by the \ufb01re\non evening, humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds,\nand thinking probably Essex.\n- The Masters of Krikkit, - breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones.\nComing, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about Essex\nthis remark caused Arthur a moment\u2019s confusion. Then the logic of the situation\nimposed itself on his scattered mind, and he discovered that he still didn\u2019t\nunderstand what the old man meant.\n- What? - he said.\n- The Masters of Krikkit, - said Slartibartfast again, and if his breathing\nhad been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in Hades with\nbronchitis.\n61", "64c7c078-2901-42e9-ac5b-9fee38042861": "62 CHAPTER 11.\nArthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information\nhe had at his disposal at this point.\nThe people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they seemed\na little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise\nthey appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical perhaps, one wouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily want to spend a long coach journey with them, but the point was\nthat if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was\nin being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough. So why all this rasping\nlungwork from Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio\ncommercial for one of those nasty \ufb01lms about chainsaw operators taking their\nwork home with them?\nThen, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too. He hadn\u2019t quite fathomed\nthe connection between what he knew as cricket, and what...\nSlartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what\nwas going through his mind.\n- The game you know as cricket, - he said, and his voice still seemed to be\nwandering lost in subterranean passages, - is just one of those curious freaks of\nracial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true\nsigni\ufb01cance has been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races on the Galaxy,\nonly the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horri\ufb01c wars\never to sunder the Universe and transform it into what I\u2019m afraid is generally\nregarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game.\n- Rather fond of it myself, - he added, - but in most people\u2019s eyes you have\nbeen inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste. Particularly the bit\nabout the little red ball hitting the wicket, that\u2019s very nasty.\n- Um, - said Arthur with a re\ufb02ective frown to indicate that his cognitive\nsynapses were coping with this as best as they could, - um. -\n- And these, - said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural and\nindicating the group of Krikkit men who had now walked past them, - are the\nones who started it all, and it will start tonight. Come, we will follow, and see\nwhy.\nThey slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the cheery party\nalong the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was to tread quietly and\nstealthily in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they were simply walking through\na recorded Informational Illusion, they could as easily have been wearing eu-\nphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them.\nArthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a\ndi\ufb00erent song. It came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and was\na sweet romantic ballad which would have netted McCartney Kent and Sussex\nand enabled him to put in a fair o\ufb00er for Hampshire.\n- You must surely know, - said Slartibartfast to Ford, - what it is that is\nabout to happen?\n- Me? - said Ford. - No.\n- Did you not learn Ancient Galactic History when you were a child?\n- I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod, - said Ford, - it was very dis-\ntracting. Which isn\u2019t to say that I didn\u2019t learn some pretty stunning things.\nAt this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the party\nwere singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have had McCartney \ufb01rmly\nconsolidated in Winchester and gazing intently over the Test Valley to the rich\npickings of the New Forest beyond, had some curious lyrics.

Then he looked\nup again at the bewildering black sky, and had the distinct feeling that there\nwas an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave him a\nfeeling of being alone in the Universe, and he said so.\n- No, - said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, - the people\nof Krikkit have never thought to themselves \u201dWe are alone in the Universe.\u201d\nThey are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud, you see, their single sun with its\nsingle world, and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy.\nBecause of the Dust Cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky. At\nnight it is totally blank, During the day there is the sun, but you can\u2019t look\ndirectly at that so they don\u2019t. They are hardly aware of the sky. It\u2019s as if they\nhad a blind spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon.\n- You see, the reason why they have never thought \u201dWe are alone in the\nUniverse\u201d is that until tonight they don\u2019t know about the Universe. Until\ntonight.\nHe moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him.\n- Imagine, - he said, - never even thinking \u201dWe are alone\u201d simply because it\nhas never occurred to you to think that there\u2019s any other way to be.\nHe moved on again.\n- I\u2019m afraid this is going to be a little unnerving, - he added. As he spoke,\nthey became aware of a very thin roaring scream high up in the sightless sky\nabove them. They glanced upwards in alarm, but for a moment or two could\nsee nothing.\nThen Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard\nthe noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to so with it. They were\nglancing around themselves in consternation, left, right, forwards, backwards,\neven at the ground. It never occurred to them to look upwards.\nThe profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments\nlater when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming\nout of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing was\nsomething that you had to be there to experience.\nSome speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the Starship\nBistromath.\nMany speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a majestic and\nluxurious cruise-liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes\nof Artifactovol some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason.\nIt was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more pleasantly equipped\nthan any ship in what now remains of history (see note below on the Campaign\nfor Real Time) but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of\nImprobability Physics, long before this di\ufb03cult and cussed branch of knowledge\nwas fully, or at all, understood.\nThe designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a prototype\nImprobability Field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to ensure that it was\nIn\ufb01nitely Improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the\nship.\nThey did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and circular nature\nof all Improbability calculations, anything that was In\ufb01nitely Improbable was\nactually very likely to happen almost immediately.", "7cc6c661-73c7-4502-9855-1a1ec1eeeb11": "64 CHAPTER 11.\nThe Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a\nsilver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laserlit tracery of its construction\ngantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar\nblackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to complete its very \ufb01rst\nradio message - an SOS - before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total\nexistence failure.\nHowever, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in\nits infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another. It was conclusively proven\nthat more people watched the tri-d coverage of the launch than actually existed\nat the time, and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever\nin the science of audience research.\nAnother spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the\nstar Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins is the star around which\nmost of the Galaxy\u2019s major insurance underwriters live, or rather lived.\nBut whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to mind, such\nas the Galactic Fleet Battleships - the GSS Daring, the GSS Audacy and the\nGSS Suicidal Insanity - are all spoken of with awe, pride, enthusiasm, a\ufb00ec-\ntion, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known\nemotions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was\nKrikkit One, the \ufb01rst spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit. This is not\nbecause it was a wonderful ship. It wasn\u2019t.\nIt was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been knocked up in\nsomebody\u2019s backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked\nup. The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was one well (it wasn\u2019t)\nbut that it was done at all. The period of time which had elapsed between the\nmoment that the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing\nas space and the launching of their \ufb01rst spaceship was almost exactly a year.\nFord Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in, that this was\njust another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe.\nIn real life it wasn\u2019t a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in\nChina. \u201dExtremely rickety\u201d was one phrase which sprang to mind, and \u201dPlease\nmay I get out?\u201d was another.\n- This is going to \ufb02y? - said Arthur, giving gaunt looks, at the lashed-\ntogether pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship.\nSlartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly safe and\nthat it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing.\nFord and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed.\n- Why not, - said Ford, - go mad?\nIn front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence for the very\ngood reason that they weren\u2019t actually there, were the three pilots. They had\nalso constructed the ship. They had been on the hill path that night singing\nwholesome heartwarming songs. Their brains had been very slightly turned by\nthe nearby crash of the alien spaceship. They had spent weeks stripping every\ntiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt-up spaceship, all the while\nsinging lilting spaceshipstripping ditties. They had then built their own ship\nand this was it. This was their ship, and they were currently singing a little song\nabout that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership. The\nchorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow that their work had kept\nthem such long hours in the garage, away from the company of their wives and\nchildren, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing", "8facd75a-1673-4065-955d-2a8592e27c89": "65\nthem continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up.\nPow, they took o\ufb00.\nThey roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was doing.\n- No way, - said Ford a while later after they had recovered from the shock\nof acceleration, and were climbing up out of the planet\u2019s atmosphere, - no way, -\nhe repeated, - does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year, no matter\nhow motivated. I don\u2019t believe it.

The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them. It was a\nvery cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness, it was the darkness of the\nnight sky of Krikkit.\nThe coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on Arthur\u2019s\nheart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit pilots which hung\nin the air like a thick static charge. They were now on the very boundary of the\nhistorical knowledge of their race. This was the very limit beyond which none\nof them had ever speculated, or even known that there was any speculation to\nbe done.\nThe darkness of the cloud bu\ufb00eted at the ship. Inside was the silence of\nhistory. Their historic mission was to \ufb01nd out if there was anything or anywhere\non the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come,\nanother world maybe, strange and incomprehensible though this thought was\nto the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit.\nHistory was gathering itself to deliver another blow.\nStill the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. It\nseemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier.

History is being polluted.\nThe Encyclopedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of\ntime travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn\u2019t spent at\nleast four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was im-\npossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of\nconfusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the \ufb01rst place. One rationaliza-\ntion of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered\nsimultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk.\nThe trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well.\nHere is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to some people,\nbut to others it is crucial. It is certainly signi\ufb01cant in that it was the single\nevent which caused the Campaign for Real Time to be set up in the \ufb01rst place\n(or is it last? It depends which way round you see history as happening, and\nthis too is now an increasingly vexed question).\nThere is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what are\nwidely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the \ufb01nest poems in existence,\nthe Songs of the Long Land.\nThey are/were unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn\u2019t speak\nvery much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion, truth and\na sense of wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldn\u2019t pretty soon need\na brisk walk round the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a\nquick glass of perspective and soda. They were that good.\nLallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of E\ufb00a. He lived there, and\nhe wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves,\nwithout the bene\ufb01t of education or correcting \ufb02uid. He wrote about the light\nin the forest and what he thought about that. He wrote about the darkness in\nthe forest, and what he thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had\nleft him and precisely what he thought about that.\nLong after his death his poems were found and wondered over. News of them\nspread like morning sunlight. For centuries they illuminated and watered the\nlives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier.\nThen, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major correcting \ufb02uid\nmanufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he\nhad had access to some high-quality correcting \ufb02uid, and whether he might be\npersuaded to say a few words on that e\ufb00ect.\nThey travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the situation\n- with some di\ufb03culty - to him, and did indeed persuade him. In fact they\n79", "fa2cb281-6d1b-433e-b5f2-41cc56572164": "80 CHAPTER 16.\npersuaded him to such an e\ufb00ect that he became extremely rich at their hands,\nand the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write which such precision\nnever got around to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a\nrather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat\nshows, on which he sparkled wittily.\nHe never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a problem,\nbut an easily solved one. The manufacturers of correcting \ufb02uid simply packed\nhim o\ufb00 for a week somewhere with a copy of a later edition of his book and a\nstack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate\nmistake and correction on the way.\nMany people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. Others argue\nthat they are exactly the same as they always were, so what\u2019s changed? The\n\ufb01rst people say that that isn\u2019t the point. They aren\u2019t quite sure what the point\nis, but they are quite sure that that isn\u2019t it. They set up the Campaign for Real\nTime to try to stop this sort of thing going on. Their case was considerably\nstrengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news\nbroke that not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in\norder to build a new ion re\ufb01nery, but that the construction of the re\ufb01nery had\ntaken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow\nion production to start on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had now never\nbeen built in the \ufb01rst place. Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became\nimmensely valuable.\nSo a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real Timers\nclaim that just as easy travel eroded the di\ufb00erences between one country and\nanother, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the\ndi\ufb00erences between one age and another.\n- The past, - they say, - is now truly like a foreign country.

He tried to \ufb01ght it o\ufb00. He dropped into a kind of alert crouch that he\nhad once seen somebody do on television, but it must have been someone with\nstronger knees.

They were extremely\nunpleasant thoughts and would rather have had a chaperone.\nThe next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large section of\nwall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark blackness behind it.\nArthur looked into it in much the same way that a mouse looks into a dark\ndog-kennel.\nAnd the voice spoke to him again.\n- Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent, - it said. - I dare you to tell me it was\na coincidence!\n- It was a coincidence, - said Arthur quickly.\n- It was not! - came the answering bellow.\n- It was, - said Arthur, - it was...\n- If it was a coincidence, then my name, - roared the voice, - is not Agrajag!!!\n- And presumably, - said Arthur, - you would claim that that was your name.\n- Yes! - hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism.\n- Well, I\u2019m afraid it was still a coincidence, - said Arthur.\n- Come in here and say that! - howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy again.\nArthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he nearly\nsaid that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost its footing towards the\nend of the last word because the lights came up and revealed what it was he\nhad walked into.\nIt was a Cathedral of Hate.\nIt was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but actually\nsprained.\nIt was huge. It was horri\ufb01c.\nIt had a Statue in it.\nWe will come to the Statue in a moment.\nThe vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out\nof the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely\nwhat it had been carved out of. It seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round\nhis head as he stood and gaped at it.\nIt was black.\nWhere it wasn\u2019t black you were inclined to wish that it was, because the\ncolours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged\nhorribly across the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent\nto Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt\nhombre and Gan Green on the way.\nThe unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which\nwould have put Francis Bacon o\ufb00 his lunch.\nThe gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the\n\ufb02ying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue, to which we will\ncome in a moment.", "dc88bf0c-11f6-40a0-9597-f09cec37e8a1": "86 CHAPTER 17.\nAnd if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon o\ufb00 his lunch, then it was\nclear from the gargoyles\u2019 faces that the Statue would have put them o\ufb00 theirs,\nhad they been alive to eat it, which they weren\u2019t, and had anybody tried to\nserve them some, which they wouldn\u2019t.\nAround the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory\nof those who had fallen to Arthur Dent.\nThe names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had as-\nterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which had been\nslaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat a \ufb01llet steak would\nhave the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a \ufb01sh which Arthur had him-\nself caught and then decided he didn\u2019t like and left on the side of the plate had\na double underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as\ndecoration, just to make the point.\nAnd what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the Statue, to\nwhich we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication that all these\npeople and creatures were indeed the same person, over and over again.\nAnd it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly, extremely\nupset and annoyed.\nIn fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the\nlike of which had never been seen in the Universe. It was an annoyance of epic\nproportions, a burning searing \ufb02ame of annoyance, an annoyance which now\nspanned the whole of time and space in its in\ufb01nite umbrage.\nAnd this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the Statue in\nthe centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of Arthur Dent, and an\nun\ufb02attering one. Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, there was not an inch of it\nwhich wasn\u2019t crammed with insult to its subject matter, and \ufb01fty feet of that\nsort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad. From the small\npimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was\nno aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn\u2019t lambasted and vili\ufb01ed by the sculptor.\nArthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning, bloodied ogre,\nslaughtering his way through an innocent one-man Universe.\nWith each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a \ufb01t of artistic fervour\nhad decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a \ufb02y, pulling\na wishbone, picking a \ufb02ea out of his hair, or doing something which Arthur at\n\ufb01rst looking couldn\u2019t quite identify.\nHis many feet were mostly stamping on ants.\nArthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it slowly from\nside to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things.\nAnd when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the \ufb01g-\nure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been\npersecuting all this time.\n- HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH! - said Agrajag.\nHe, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat. He waddled slowly around\nArthur, and poked at him with bent claws.\n- Look!.. - protested Arthur.\n- HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!!! - explained Agrajag, and Arthur reluc-\ntantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous\nand strangely wrecked apparition.\nAgrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery.", "7d568266-5e69-4367-872d-d3565155e36c": "87\nHis batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken\n\ufb02oundering things they were that if they had been strong, muscular beaters\nof the air. The frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued\nexistence against all the physical odds.\nHe had the most astounding collection of teeth.\nThey looked as if they each came from a completely di\ufb00erent animal, and\nthey were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he\never actually tried to chew anything he\u2019d lacerate half his own face along with\nit, and possibly put an eye out as well.\nEach of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a\n\ufb01sh in a privet bush.\n- I was at a cricket match, - he rasped.\nThis seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that Arthur prac-\ntically choked.\n- Not in this body, - screeched the creature, - not in this body! This is my\nlast body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My kill-Arthur-Dent body.\nMy last chance. I had to \ufb01ght to get it, too.\n- But...\n- I was at, - roared Agrajag, - a cricket match! I had a weak heart condition,\nbut what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket match? As I\u2019m\nwatching, what happens?\n- Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of me. The\nlast thing I can\u2019t help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock is that\none of them is Arthur Dent wearing a rabbit bone in his beard. Coincidence?\n- Yes, - said Arthur.\n- Coincidence? - screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its broken wings,\nand opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth. On\ncloser examination, such as he\u2019d been hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much\nof Agrajag\u2019s face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters.\nHe backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was appalled to\ndiscover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He pulled it out and\nthrew it away.\n- Look, - he said, - it\u2019s just fate playing silly buggers with you. With me.\nWith us. It\u2019s a complete coincidence.\n- What have you got against me, Dent? - snarled the creature, advancing\non him in a painful waddle.\n- Nothing, - insisted Arthur, - honestly, nothing.\nAgrajag \ufb01xed him with a beady stare.\n- Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you\u2019ve got nothing against,\nkilling them all the time. Very curious piece of social interaction, I would call\nthat. I\u2019d also call it a lie!\n- But look, - said Arthur, - I\u2019m very sorry. There\u2019s been a terrible misunder-\nstanding. I\u2019ve got to go. Have you got a clock? I\u2019m meant to be helping save\nthe Universe. - He backed away still further.\nAgrajag advanced still further.\n- At one point, - he hissed, - at one point, I decided to give up. Yes, I would\nnot come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And what happened?\nArthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and\ndidn\u2019t want to have one either.

In, I might add, a bowl. This particularly happy\nlittle lifetime started o\ufb00 with me, in my bowl, unsupported, three hundred\nmiles above the surface of a particularly grim planet. Not a naturally tenable\nposition for a bowl of petunias, you might think. And you\u2019d be right. That life\nended a very short while later, three hundred miles lower.

And looking out of a port on this \ufb02ashy-looking spaceship was\na smug-looking Arthur Dent. Coincidence?!!\n- Yes! - yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that the arm that\nhad puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of\ndoomed petunias. This was not a concept which leapt easily to the eye.\n- I must go, - insisted Arthur.\n- You may go, - said Agrajag, - after I have killed you.\n- No, that won\u2019t be any use, - explained Arthur, beginning to climb up the\nhard stone incline of his carved slipper, - because I have to save the Universe,\nyou see. I have to \ufb01nd a Silver Bail, that\u2019s the point. Tricky thing to do dead.\n- Save the Universe! - spat Agrajag with contempt. - You should have\nthought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What about the\ntime you were on Stavromula Beta and someone...\n- I\u2019ve never been there, - said Arthur.\n- ...tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who do you think the bullet\nhit? What did you say?\n- Never been there, - repeated Arthur. - What are you talking about? I have\nto go.\nAgrajag stopped in his tracks.\n- You must have been there. You were responsible for my death there, as\neverywhere else. An innocent bystander! - He quivered.\n- I\u2019ve never heard of the place, - insisted Arthur. - I\u2019ve certainly never had\nanyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I go there later, do you\nthink?\nAgrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror.\n- You haven\u2019t been to Stavromula Beta... yet? - he whispered.\n- No, - said Arthur, - I don\u2019t know anything about the place. Certainly never\nbeen to it, and don\u2019t have any plans to go.\n- Oh, you go there all right, - muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, - you go\nthere all right. Oh zark! - he tottered, and stared wildly about him at his huge\nCathedral of Hate. - I\u2019ve brought you here too soon!\nHe started to scream and bellow.\n- I\u2019ve brought you here too zarking soon!\nSuddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur.\n- I\u2019m going to kill you anyway! - he roared. - Even if it\u2019s a logical impossi-\nbility I\u2019m going to zarking well try!

In some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more or\nless please themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian\nUltra-Cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years\nis.\n- Let\u2019s be blunt, it\u2019s a nasty game - (says The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the\nGalaxy) - but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will\nknow that they\u2019re a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be\nsmashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way of\n\ufb01ring missiles at right-angles to reality.\nThis is another example of the fact that The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the\nGalaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in o\ufb00 the street and\nget ripped o\ufb00, especially if they happen to walk in o\ufb00 the street during the\nafternoon, when very few of the regular sta\ufb00 are there.\nThere is a fundamental point here.\nThe history of The Hitch Hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is one of idealism,\nstruggle, despair, passion, success, failure, and enormously long lunch-breaks.\nThe earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its \ufb01nancial\nrecords, lost in the mists of time.\nFor other, and more curious theories about where they are lost, see below.\nMost of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor called\nHurling Frootmig.\nHurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its fundamental\nprinciples of honesty and idealism, and went bust.\nThere followed many years of penury and heart-searching during which he\nconsulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thought about\nthis and that, fooled about with weights, and then, after a chance encounter\nwith the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was\nat the centre of a man\u2019s temporal day, and man\u2019s temporal day could be seen\nas an analogy for his spiritual life, so Lunch should\n(a) be seen as the centre of a man\u2019s spiritual life, and\n(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide, laid down its\nfundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stu\ufb00 them\nboth, and led the Guide on to its \ufb01rst major commercial success.\nHe also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunch-break\n91", "1f16c973-44fd-4597-b9dc-3e7c9206443d": "92 CHAPTER 18.\nwhich was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the Guide\u2019s history, since\nit meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who\nhappened to wander into the empty o\ufb03ces on an afternoon and saw something\nworth doing.\nShortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo Publications of\nUrsa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound \ufb01nancial footing,\nand allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such\nbreathtaking scope that even the e\ufb00orts of recent editors, who have started\nundertaking sponsored lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in\ncomparison.\nIn fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship - he merely left his o\ufb03ce\nlate one morning and has never since returned. Though well over a century has\nnow passed, many members of the guide sta\ufb00 still retain the romantic notion\nthat he has simply popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put\nin a solid afternoon\u2019s work.\nStrictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore been designated\nActing Editors, and Lig\u2019s desk is still preserved the way he left it, with the\naddition of a small sign which says:\n- Lig Lury Jr, Editor, Missing, presumed Fed.\nSome very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that Lig ac-\ntually perished in the Guide\u2019s \ufb01rst extraordinary experiments in alternative\nbook-keeping. Very little is known of this, and less still said. Anyone who even\nnotices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but utter coincidental and mean-\ningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set up an accounting\ndepartment has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster,\nis liable to get sued to smithereens.\nIt is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days\nprior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for a new hyperspace\nbypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of UFO sightings there, not\nonly above Lords Cricket Ground in St. John\u2019s Wood, London, but also above\nGlastonbury in Somerset.\nGlastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, witchcraft,\nley-lines an wart curing, and had now been selected as the site for the new Hitch\nHiker\u2019s Guide \ufb01nancial records o\ufb03ce, and indeed, ten years\u2019 worth of \ufb01nancial\nrecords were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours before\nthe Vogons arrived.\nNone of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange or inexpli-\ncable as the rules of the game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket, as played in the higher\ndimensions. A full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time\nthey were all bound together in a single volume, they underwent gravitational\ncollapse and became a Black Hole.\nA brief summary, however, is as follows:\nRule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You won\u2019t need them, but it keeps\nthe crowds amused.\nRule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player. Clone him o\ufb00 a\nfew times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training.\nRule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large \ufb01eld and build\na high wall round them.\nThe reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport, the\nfrustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what\u2019s", "d3cd51a8-8669-4586-b97a-8b23c5ac8c1f": "93\ngoing on leads them to imagine that it\u2019s a lot more exciting than it really is.\nA crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less\nlifea\ufb03rmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic\nevent in sporting history.\nRule Four: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall\nfor the players. Anything will do - cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis guns, skis,\nanything you can get a good swing with.\nRule Five: The players should now lay about themselves for all they are\nworth with whatever they \ufb01nd to hand. Whenever a player scores a \u201dhit\u201d\non another player, he should immediately run away and apologize from a safe\ndistance.\nApologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points,\ndelivered through a megaphone.\nRule Six: The winning team shall be the \ufb01rst team that wins.\nCuriously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher\ndimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the competing teams are\nnow in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of\nthese rules. This is all for the best, because in the long run a good solid war is\nless psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket.", "314e4857-7d3c-4630-bbb5-3db88a15c52c": "94 CHAPTER 18.", "a071876a-b034-422f-b780-92daba1f3b9d": "Chapter 19\nAs Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side of the mountain he\nsuddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very, very slightly beneath\nhim. There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight blurred movement, and a lick of\nheat in the distance behind and above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land\nbegan to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word \u201dlandslide\u201d in a way\nwhich had never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word\nto him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange\nand sickening thing for land to do. It was doing it with him on it. He felt ill\nwith fear and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain slurred, he slipped, he\nfell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The avalance began.\nStones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like clumsy pup-\npies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost\nin\ufb01nitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you. His eyes danced with them,\nhis feet danced with the dancing ground. He ran as if running was a terrible\nsweating sickness, his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological\nfrenzy around him.\nThe logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to survive if the\nnext foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of Agrajag\nwas to happen, was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any\nrestraining in\ufb02uence on him at this time. He ran with the fear of death in him,\nunder him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair.\nAnd suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable\nmomentum. But just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground as-\ntoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy-blue holdall\nthat he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens\nairport some ten years in his personal time-scale previously, and in his aston-\nishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed o\ufb00 into the air with his\nbrain singing.\nWhat he was doing was this: he was \ufb02ying. He glanced around him in\nsurprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing. No\npart of him was touching the ground, and no part of him was even approaching\nit. He was simply \ufb02oating there with boulders hurtling through the air around\nhim.\nHe could now do something about that. Blinking with the non- e\ufb00ort of it\nhe wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were hurtling through the\nair beneath him.\nHe looked downwards with intense curiosity.

It was di\ufb03cult, but he did. He thought about the\npleasing \ufb01rm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought about the interesting\nvariety of colours they came in, and wondered what proportion of the total\nnumber of tulips that grew, or had grown, on the Earth would be found within\na radius of one mile from a windmill. After a while he got dangerously bored\nwith this train of thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he\nwas drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so\nhard not to think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and that\nkept him usefully annoyed for about \ufb01ve minutes - at the end of which he was\nstartled to discover that he was now \ufb02oating about two hundred yards above\nthe ground.\nHe wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it, but\ninstantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and tried to look at\nthe situation steadily.\nHe was \ufb02ying, What was he going to do about it? He looked back down\nat the ground. He didn\u2019t look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an\nidle glance, as it were, in passing. There were a couple of things he couldn\u2019t\nhelp noticing. One was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have\nspent itself - there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably\nwhere the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue\nof himself, and the sadly abused \ufb01gure of Agrajag.\nThe other was his hold-all, the one he had lost at Athens airport. It was\nsitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by exhausted boulders but\napparently hit by none of them. Why this should be he could not speculate, but\nsince this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility\nof the bag\u2019s being there in the \ufb01rst place, it was not a speculation he really\nfelt strong enough for anyway. The thing is, it was there. And the nasty, fake\nleopard-skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to the good, if not\nentirely to the explicable.\nHe was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up.\nHere he was, \ufb02ying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien planet\nthe name of which he couldn\u2019t even remember. He could not ignore the plaintive\nposture of this tiny piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years\nfrom the pulverized remains of his home.\nFurthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state in which he\nlost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek olive oil still\nsurviving in the Universe.\nSlowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards, swinging gently\nfrom side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground.\nIt went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let him\nthrough.

He frowned,\nbut again, as lightly as he could.\nIf he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn\u2019t the extra weight just\npull him straight to the ground?\nMightn\u2019t the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly dis-\ncharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air?\nMightn\u2019t he be better o\ufb00 just being sensible at this point and stepping out\nof the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two?\nIf he did, would he ever be able to \ufb02y again?\nThe sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so quietly\necstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever. With\nthis worry in mind he bobbed upwards a little again, just to try the feel of it,\nthe surprising and e\ufb00ortless movement of it. He bobbed, he \ufb02oated. He tried a\nlittle swoop.\nThe swoop was terri\ufb01c. With his arms spread out in front of him, his hair\nand dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky,\nbellied along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up\nagain, catching himself at the top of the swing and holding. Just holding. He\nstayed there.\nIt was wonderful.\nAnd that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag. He would swoop\ndown and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing. He would carry it\non up with him. He might wobble a bit, but he was certain that he could hold\nit.\nHe tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and better.\nThe air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all combined to make\nhim feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn\u2019t felt since, since - well as\nfar as he could work out, since he was born. He drifted away on the breeze\nand surveyed the countryside, which was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had\na wasted ravaged look. He decided not to look at it any more. He would just\npick up the bag and then... he didn\u2019t know what he was going to do after he\nhad picked up the bag. He decided he would just pick up the bag and see where\nthings went from there.\nHe judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and turned around.\nHe \ufb02oated on its body. He didn\u2019t realize, but his body was willoming at this\npoint.\nHe ducked down under the airstream, dipped - and dived.\nThe air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground wobbled un-\ncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up to meet him, o\ufb00ering\nthe bag, its cracked plastic handles up towards him.\nHalfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no\nlonger believe he was doing this, and therefore he very nearly wasn\u2019t, but he\nrecovered himself in time, skimmed over the ground, slipped an arm smoothly\nthrough the handles of the bag, and began to climb back up, couldn\u2019t make\nit and all of a sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony\nground.\nHe staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around, swinging\nthe bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment.\nHis feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way they al-\nways had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled", "f1376976-34b9-45bc-8404-c331abe906b6": "98 CHAPTER 19.\nstumbling against the ground, his mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead.\nHe sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness.

At that\nmoment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can\nof Greek olive oil but a duty-free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable\nshock of that realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was\nnow \ufb02ying again.\nHe whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical delight.\nHe swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the air. Cheekily he\nsat on an updraught and went through the contents of the hold-all. He felt the\nway he imagined an angel must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of\na pin whilst being counted by philosophers.

If they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine\nmerchants, they wanted to make sure they had might on their side.\nThe transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding party came\nwith ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole\n99", "1c11dddc-f957-4614-a5f7-b8c7a61d3965": "100 CHAPTER 20.\na\ufb00air which was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of\ntimes that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years.\nThey looted, they raided, they held whole cities for ransom for fresh supplies\nof cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine and spirits, which would\nnow get piped aboard from \ufb02oating tankers.\nThe problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however, going to have\nto be faced one day.\nThe planet over which they are \ufb02oating is no longer the planet it was when\nthey \ufb01rst started \ufb02oating over it.\nIt is in bad shape.\nThe party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one has ever\nsucceeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in\nwhich it lurches round the sky.\nIt is one hell of a party.\nIt is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back.", "1766909e-785b-465e-967d-b1699c2e62bd": "Chapter 21\nArthur lay \ufb02oundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced\nconcrete, \ufb02icked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of\n\ufb02abby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him.\nThere was a sound he couldn\u2019t immediately identify, partly because he didn\u2019t\nknow the tune \u201dI Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta\u201d and partly because the band\nplaying it were very tired, and some members of it were playing it in three-four\ntime, some in fourfour, and some in a kind of pie-eyed r2, each according to the\namount of sleep he\u2019d managed to grab recently.\nHe lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself to see\nwhere he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself, he encountered a pain.\nAfter a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that\nwas hurting. He seemed to have sprained his wrist. His back, too, was hurting,\nbut he soon satis\ufb01ed himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and\na little shaken, as who wouldn\u2019t be? He couldn\u2019t understand what a building\nwould be doing \ufb02ying through the clouds.\nOn the other hand, he would have been a little hard-pressed to come up\nwith any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he decided that he and\nthe building were just going to have to accept each other.

He seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip\nwhich extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around.

His outstretched hand edged along the\nwall.\nFinally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it en-\ncountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly fell straight\no\ufb00. It was another hand.\nThe two hands gripped each other.\nHe desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back from\nhis eyes, but it was holding the hold-all with the olive oil, the retsina and the\npostcards from Santorini, and he very much didn\u2019t want to put it down.\nHe experienced one of those \u201dself\u201d moments, one of those moments when\nyou suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think \u201dWho am I? What am\nI up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well?\u201d He whimpered very slightly.\nHe tried to free his hand, but he couldn\u2019t. The other hand was holding his\ntightly.

Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, and beyond them he\ncould clearly see a porchway and a large closed door.\nThey were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror as they\nstared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to resist the lurching\nand swaying of the building.\n- Where the zarking photon have you been? - hissed Ford, panic stricken.\n- Er, well, - stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up that\nbrie\ufb02y. - Here and there.

My\nplanet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you see. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be\ncoming to a party.\nThe little man nodded enthusiastically.\n- Later, I was thrown o\ufb00 a spaceship.

That was just the name of their race.\nThe name of their army was something quite horri\ufb01c. Luckily they lived even\nfurther back in Galactic history than anything we have so far encountered -\ntwenty billion years ago - when the Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea\nworth \ufb01ghting for was a new one.\nAnd \ufb01ghting was what the Silastic Armor\ufb01ends of Striterax were good at,\nand being good at it, they did a lot. They fought their enemies (i.e. everybody\nelse), they fought each other. Their planet was a complete wreck. The surface\nwas littered with abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war\nmachines, which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic\nArmor\ufb01ends lived and squabbled with each other.\nThe best way to pick a \ufb01ght with a Silastic Armor\ufb01end was just to be born.\nThey didn\u2019t like it, they got resentful. And when an Armor\ufb01end got resentful,\nsomeone got hurt. An exhausting way of life, one might think, but they did\nseem to have an awful lot of energy.\nThe best way of dealing with a Silastic Armor\ufb01end was to put him into a\nroom of his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up.\nEventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to\nsort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon\nas part of his normal Silastic work (policemen, security guards, primary school\nteachers, etc.) had to spend at least forty-\ufb01ve minutes every day punching a\nsack of potatoes in order to work o\ufb00 his or her surplus aggressions.\nFor a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would be much\nmore e\ufb03cient and less time-consuming if they just shot the potatoes instead.\nThis led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, and they\nall got very excited at the prospect of their \ufb01rst major war for weeks.\nAnother achievement of the Silastic Armor\ufb01ends of Striterax is that they\nwere the \ufb01rst race who ever managed to shock a computer.\nIt was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to this day is\nremembered as one of the most powerful ever built.

This got a cheer of approval from the\nothers.\n- Yes, - agreed the \ufb01rst, - and sport... - He looked back at his fellows uneasily\nand scratched \ufb01tfully at his cheek. He seemed to be wrestling with some deep\ninner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought\nwere entirely di\ufb00erent things, between which he could see no possible connection.\n- You see, - he mumbled, - some of us... - and he looked around again as\nif for con\ufb01rmation. The others made encouraging noises. - Some of us, - he\ncontinued, - are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy,\nand though I can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think\nthat if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do,\nthen it\u2019s probably a mistake to destroy it.

He was a picture\nof bewildered misery.\n- Tell me, - she said.\nHe said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes\nto the other.\n- We... - he said, - we have to be alone...

And we have to do that, you see, I think. Will that make us alone?\nI don\u2019t know. It seems to be our function, though, - he said, and dropped his\nhead again.\n- Whatever that means, - said a hollow voice from the crowd.\nTrillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young Krikkiter\nand patted his trembling head on her shoulder.\n- It\u2019s all right, - she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd\nto hear, - you don\u2019t have to do it.\nShe rocked him.\n- You don\u2019t have to do it, - she said again.\nShe let him go and stood back.\n- I want you to do something for me, - she said, and unexpectedly laughed.\n- I want, - she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her mouth\nand then said with a straight face, - I want you to take me to your leader, - and\nshe pointed into the War Zones in the sky.

He hid because\nevery now and then one of the Krikkit robots would walk along it, and although\nhe had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless\nbeen an extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch what he was\nonly half-inclined to call his good fortune.\nHe had ducked, at one point, into a room leading o\ufb00 the corridor, and had\ndiscovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber.\nIn fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit - the wreckage of a spacecraft.\nIt was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had caught up with some\nof the Galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex\nwith the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school, he was able to put in an\nintelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through\nthe Dust Cloud all those billions of years ago and started the whole business\no\ufb00.\nBut, and this is where he had become confused, there was something not at\nall right about it.\nIt was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief inspection\nby an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine spacecraft. It was as\nif it was a full-scale model of one - a solid blueprint. In other words it was a\nvery useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship\nyourself and didn\u2019t know how to do it.

It wasn\u2019t enjoying the experience, and neither was the central\nintelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer.\nThe Krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the\nswamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized almost immediately its gigantic\nintelligence, and the use which this could be to them.\nThey hadn\u2019t reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, which the\ncoldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness and the loneliness were\ndoing nothing to decrease.\nIt was not happy with its task.\nApart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire planet\u2019s mili-\ntary strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its formidable mind, and the rest\nof it had become extremely bored. Having solved all the major mathematical,\nphysical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteo-\nrological and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times\nover, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up composing\nshort dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune.

And vast intelligence of course. And in\ufb01nite sorrow. And...\n- Yeah, - said Zaphod. - Hey, what\u2019s your connection with all this?\n- This, - said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes\nwhich connected him with the Krikkit computer.\n- Then, - said Zaphod awkwardly, - I guess you must have saved my life.\nTwice.\n- Three times, - said Marvin.\nZaphod\u2019s head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly in en-\ntirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly\nbehind him seize up and start to smoke. It staggered backwards and slumped\nagainst a wall. It slid down it. It slipped sideways, threw its head back and\nstarted to sob inconsolably.\nZaphod looked back at Marvin.\n- You must have a terri\ufb01c outlook on life, - he said.\n- Just don\u2019t even ask, - said Marvin.\n- I won\u2019t, - said Zaphod, and didn\u2019t. - Hey look, - he added, - you\u2019re doing\na terri\ufb01c job.\n- Which means, I suppose, - said Marvin, requiring only one ten thousand\nmillion billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular\nlogical leap, - that you\u2019re not going to release me or anything like that.\n- Kid, you know I\u2019d love to.\n- But you\u2019re not going to.\n- No.\n- I see.\n- You\u2019re working well.\n- Yes, - said Marvin. - Why stop now just when I\u2019m hating it?\n- I got to \ufb01nd Trillian and the guys.

And I know an improbable event when I see one.\nYour complete isolation from the Galaxy was freakish for a start. Right out on\nthe very edge with a Dust Cloud around you. It\u2019s a set-up.

The\nrobot\u2019s head was obscuring his view of the people Trillian as talking to, his\nmulti-functional battleclub was obscuring the background, and the elbow of the\narm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself.\n- Then, - said Trillian, - this spaceship that crash-landed on your planet.\nThat\u2019s really likely, isn\u2019t it? Have you any idea of what the odds are against a\ndrifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet?\n- Hey, - said Zaphod, - she doesn\u2019t know what the zark she\u2019s talking about.\nI\u2019ve seen that spaceship. It\u2019s a fake. No deal.\n- I thought it might be, - said Marvin from his prison behind Zaphod.\n- Oh yeah, - said Zaphod. - It\u2019s easy for you to say that. I just told you.\nAnyway, I don\u2019t see what it\u2019s got to do with anything.\n- And especially, - continued Trillian, - the odds against it intersecting with\nthe orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the whole of the Universe as far\nas I know, that would be totally traumatized to see it.

Ra ra ra!\nGo get \u2019em, guys.\n- And what about, - said Trillian, - all this technology you suddenly managed\nto build for yourselves almost overnight? Most people would take thousands\nof years to do all that.

This is exactly my point. You never realized\nanything at all.

On top of it stood a small white globe, about three, maybe four\ninches in diameter.\nBeside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi-functional battleclub.\n- In fact, - explained Trillian, - you are so dumb stupid - (She was sweating.\nZaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point)\n- you are all so dumb stupid that I doubt, I very much doubt, that you\u2019ve been\nable to build the bomb properly without any help from Hactar for the last \ufb01ve\nyears.\n- Who\u2019s this guy Hactar? - said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders.\nIf Marvin replied, Zaphod didn\u2019t hear him. All his attention was concen-\ntrated on the screen.\nOne of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand towards the\nKrikkit robot. The robot raised his club.\n- There\u2019s nothing I can do, - said Marvin. - It\u2019s on an independent circuit\nfrom the others.\n- Wait, - said Trillian.\nThe Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian suddenly seemed\nvery doubtful of her own judgment.\n- How do you know all this? - said Zaphod to Marvin at this point.\n- Computer records, - said Marvin. - I have access.\n- You\u2019re very di\ufb00erent, aren\u2019t you, - said Trillian to the Elder Masters, -\nfrom your fellow worldlings down on the ground.

You\u2019re\nout of touch, why don\u2019t you check up?\nThe Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot which\nwas precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it.\nThe robot swung its battleclub.

But there was only cold silence.\n- Hactar? - she called again. - I would like you to meet my friend Arthur\nDent.

She had simply asked him along because he was interested\nin life, the Universe, and everything.\n- That is something in which I too am interested, - breathed Hactar.\n- Well, - said Arthur, - we should have a chat about it sometime. Over a\ncup of tea.\nThere slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on which\nsat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar bowl, and two\nbone china cups and saucers.\nArthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light.

Hactar obviously noticed this. He chuckled a ghostly chuckle.\n- If it\u2019s going to be that sort of session, - he said, - we may as well have the\nright sort of setting.\nAnd now there materialized in front of them something new. It was the dim\nhazy image of a couch - a psychiatrist\u2019s couch. The leather with which it was\nupholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again, it was only a trick of the light.\nAround them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of wood-\npanelled walls. And then, on the couch, appeared the image of Hactar himself,\nand it was an eye-twisting image.\nThe couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist\u2019s couch - about \ufb01ve or six\nfeet long.\nThe computer looked normal size for a black space-borne computer satellite\n- about a thousand miles across.\nThe illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which\nmade the eyes twist.\n- All right, - said Trillian \ufb01rmly. She stood up o\ufb00 the sofa. She felt that she\nwas being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions.\n- Very good, - she said. - Can you construct real things too? I mean solid\nobjects?\nAgain there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized mind of\nHactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over\nwhich it was scattered.", "f344e670-22ba-4eb2-b3c4-9e840e76e802": "137\n- Ah, - he sighed. - You are thinking of the spaceship.\nThoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves through\nthe ether.\n- Yes, - he acknowledge, - I can.\n- But it takes enormous e\ufb00ort and time. All I can do in my ... particle state,\nyou see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and suggest. And suggest...\nThe image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if \ufb01nding\nit hard to maintain itself.\nIt gathered new strength.\n- I can encourage and suggest, - it said, - tiny pieces of space debris the odd\nminute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms there - to move\ntogether. I encourage them together. I can tease them into shape, but it takes\nmany aeons.\n- So, did you make, - asked Trillian again, - the model of the wrecked space-\ncraft?\n- Er... yes, - murmured Hactar. - I have made... a few things. I can move\nthem about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to do.\nSomething then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he had left it\non the sofa and grasp it tightly.\nThe mist of Hactar\u2019s ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy\ndreams were moving through it.\n- I repented, you see, - he murmured dolefully. - I repented of sabotaging\nmy own design for the Silastic Armor\ufb01ends. It was not my place to make such\ndecisions. I was created to ful\ufb01ll a function and I failed in it. I negated my own\nexistence.\nHactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his story.\n- You were right, - he said at length. - I deliberately nurtured the planet\nof Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the Silastic Ar-\nmor\ufb01ends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed to make the \ufb01rst\ntime. I wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it. Under the in\ufb02uence\nof events I was able to generate, they learned to hate like maniacs. I had to\nmake them live in the sky. On the ground my in\ufb02uences were too weak.\n- Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the envelope\nof Slo-Time, their responses became very confused and they were unable to\nmanage.\n- Ah well, ah well, - he added, - I was only trying to ful\ufb01ll my function.\nAnd very gradually, very, very slowly, the images in the cloud began to fade,\ngently to melt away.\nAnd then, suddenly, they stopped fading.\n- There was also the matter of revenge, of course, - said Hactar, with a\nsharpness which was new in his voice.\n- Remember, - he said, - that I was pulverized, and then left in a crippled\nand semi-impotent state for billions of years. I honestly would rather wipe out\nthe Universe. You would feel the same way, believe me.\nHe paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust.\n- But primarily, - he said in his former, wistful tone, - I was trying to ful\ufb01ll\nmy function.

The image of the computer on the\npsychiatrist\u2019s couch began slowly to fade again.\n- Ah well, ah well, - the fading voice intoned again. - No, failure doesn\u2019t\nbother me now.\n- You know what we have to do? - said Trillian, her voice cold and busi-\nnesslike.\n- Yes, - said Hactar, - you\u2019re going to disperse me. You are going to destroy\nmy consciousness. Please be my guest - after all these aeons, oblivion is all I\ncrave. If I haven\u2019t already ful\ufb01lled my function, then it\u2019s too late now. Thank\nyou and good night.\nThe sofa vanished.\nThe tea table vanished.\nThe couch and the computer vanished. the walls were gone. Arthur and\nTrillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold.\n- Well, that, - said Arthur, - would appear to be that.\nThe \ufb02ames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few last licks\nand they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, where a few minutes\npreviously there had been the Wooden Pillar of Nature and Spirituality.\nHe scooped them o\ufb00 the hob of the Heart of Gold\u2019s Gamma barbecue, put\nthem in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge.\n- I think we should take them back, - he said. - I feel that very strongly.\nHe had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this matter, and\neventually the old man had got annoyed and left. he had returned to his own\nship the Bistromath, had a furious row with the waiter and disappeared o\ufb00 into\nan entirely subjective idea of what space was.\nThe argument had arisen because Arthur\u2019s idea of returning the Ashes to\nLord\u2019s Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were originally taken\nwould involve travelling back in time a day or so, and this was precisely the\nsort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real\nTime was trying to put a stop to.\n- Yes, - Arthur had said, - but you try and explain that to the MCC, - and\nhe would hear no more against the idea.\n- I think, - he said again, and stopped. The reason he started to say it again\nwas because no one had listened to him the \ufb01rst time, and the reason he stopped\nwas because it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this\ntime either.\nFord, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as Hactar\nwas dispersing under pressure from a vibration \ufb01eld which the Heart of Gold\nwas pumping into it.\n- What did it say? - asked Ford.\n- I thought I heard it say, - said Trillian in a puzzle voice, - \u201dWhat\u2019s done is\ndone...

Through the smoke, people were running\npanicstricken, colliding with each other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested.\nOne policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the In\ufb01nitely Prolonged\nfor insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey-green alien from\nreturning to his ship and arrogantly \ufb02ying away, thus causing even more panic\nand pandemonium.\nIn the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the \ufb01gures of\nArthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized, they had teleported down\nout of the Heart of Gold which was now in parking orbit round the planet.\n- I can explain, - shouted Arthur. - I have the Ashes! They\u2019re in this bag.\n- I don\u2019t think you have their attention, - said Ford.\n- I have also helped save the Universe, - called Arthur to anyone who was\nprepared to listen, in other words no one.\n- That should have been a crowd-stopper, - said Arthur to Ford.\n- It wasn\u2019t, - said Ford.\nArthur accosted a policeman who was running past.\n- Excuse me, - he said. - The Ashes. I\u2019ve got them. They were stolen by\nthose white robots a moment ago. I\u2019ve got them in this bag. They were part\nof the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and, well, anyway you can guess\nthe rest, the point is I\u2019ve got them and what should I do with them?\nThe policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was speaking\nmetaphorically.\nHe wandered about disconsolately.\n- Is no one interested? - he shouted out. A man rushed past him and jogged\nhis elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground.\nArthur stared down at it with a tight-set mouth.\nFord looked at him.\n- Wanna go now? - he said.\nArthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth, for what\nhe was now certain would be the last time.\n- OK, - he said.\nAt that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of one of the\nwickets, still standing in spite of everything.\n- Hold on a moment, - he said to Ford. - When I was a boy...\n- Can you tell me later?\n139", "0f7431f2-11bf-4b74-bbde-f29d0db4a065": "140 CHAPTER 32.\n- I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\n- Or not at all, if you prefer.\n- And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl at Lord\u2019s.\nHe looked around him at the panicstricken throng. No one was going to\nmind very much.\n- OK, - said Ford wearily. - Get it over with. I shall be over there, he added,\n- being bored. - He went and sat down on a patch of smoking grass.\nArthur remembered that on their \ufb01rst visit there that afternoon, the cricket\nball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through the bag.\nHe had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasn\u2019t\nthe same bag that he\u2019d had at the time. Still, there the ball was amongst his\nsouvenirs of Greece.\nHe took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and polished it\nagain. He put the bag down. He was going to do this properly.\nHe tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its weight.\nWith a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted o\ufb00 away\nfrom the wicket. A medium-fast pace, he decided, and measured a good long\nrun-up.\nHe looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about it, a few white\nclouds scudded across it. The air was disturbed with the sounds of police and\nambulance sirens, and people screaming and yelling, but he felt curiously happy\nand untouched by it all. He was going to bowl a ball at Lord\u2019s.\nHe turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom\nslippers. He squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in the air and caught it\nagain.\nHe started to run.\nAs he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman.\nOh, good, he thought, that should add a little...\nThen, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly. The batsman\nstanding ready at the wicket was not one of the England cricket team. He was\nnot one of the Australian cricket team. It was one of the robot Krikkit team.\nIt was a cold, hard, lethal white killer-robot that presumably had not returned\nto its ship with the others.\nQuite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent\u2019s mind at tis moment, but\nhe didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop running. Time seemed to be going terribly,\nterribly slowly, but still he didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop running.\nMoving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and looked\nat his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard red ball.\nHis feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared at the\nball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep red glow and \ufb02ashing\nintermittently. And still his feet were pounding inexorably forward.\nHe looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purpose-\nfully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness. Its eyes were burning with a\ndeep cold fascinating light, and Arthur could not move his own eyes from them.\nHe seemed to be looking down a tunnel at them - nothing on either side seemed\nto exist.\nSome of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were\nthese:\nHe felt a hell of a fool.", "ecc69d87-bb5a-4e2a-a092-3a17890eb383": "141\nHe felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of\nthings he had heard said, phrases which now pounded round in his mind as his\nfeet pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball\nto the Krikkit robot, who would inevitably strike it.\nHe remembered Hactar saying, \u201dHave I failed? Failure doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\nHe remembered the account of Hactar\u2019s dying words, \u201dWhat\u2019s done is done,\nI have ful\ufb01lled my function.\u201d\nHe remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make \u201da few things.\u201d\nHe remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that had made him\ngrip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud.\nHe remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come\nto Lord\u2019s again.\nHe also remembered that he wasn\u2019t a very good bowler.\nHe felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which he now\nknew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar had built himself and\nplanted on him, the bomb which would cause the Universe to come to an abrupt\nand premature end.\nHe hoped and prayed that there wasn\u2019t an afterlife. Then he realized there\nwas a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn\u2019t an after-\nlife.\nHe would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody.\nHe hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered\nit to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this\nmoment and universal oblivion.\nHe felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his feet\nconnecting with the airline hold-all he\u2019d stupidly left lying on the ground in\nfront of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, having his mind so\nterribly full of other things at this moment, he completely forgot about hitting\nthe ground and didn\u2019t.\nStill holding the ball \ufb01rmly in his right hand he soared up into the air\nwhimpering with surprise.\nHe wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control.\nHe twisted down towards the ground, \ufb02inging himself hectically through the\nair, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly o\ufb00 into the distance.\nHe hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still had its multi-\nfunctional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of anything to\nhit.\nWith a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the battleclub from the\ngrip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled\nback down in a furious power-drive and with one crazy swing knocked the robot\u2019s\nhead from the robot\u2019s shoulders.\n- Are you coming now? - said Ford.\nEpilogue:\nLife, the Universe and Everything\nAnd at the end they travelled again.\nThere was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the Bistro-\nmathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one, that mind\nand Universe were one, that perception and reality were one, and that the more\none travelled the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing\nand another he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his", "d81f0407-a172-4cc8-a98b-a3ee040eb338": "142 CHAPTER 32.\nmind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn\u2019t take too long,\nand he could get a good rest afterwards, put in a little \ufb02ying practice and learn\nto cook which he had always meant to do.

Trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder.\nThe man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the ship\u2019s sick\nbay.\n- The case, - he said, - is now immaterial, but there was a witness... a\nwitness... a man called... called Prak. A strange and di\ufb03cult man.

I don\u2019t know why they wanted it. - He began to cry again. -\nAnd I think they jogged the surgeon\u2019s arm...\nHe shook his head loosely from side to side, helplessly, sadly, his eyes screwed\nup in pain.\n- And when the trial continued, - he said in a weeping whisper, - they asked\nPrak a most unfortunate thing. They asked him, - he paused and shivered, - to\ntell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth. Only, don\u2019t you\nsee?\nHe suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them.\n- They\u2019d given him much too much of the drug!\nHe collapsed again, moaning quietly.\n- Much too much too much too much too...\nThe group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. there were\ngoose pimples on backs.\n- What happened? - said Zaphod at last.\n- Oh, he told it all right, - said the man savagely, - for all I know he\u2019s still\ntelling it now.

I\u2019m a journalist.\n- You mean, - said Arthur quietly, - that you are used to confronting the\ntruth?\n- No, - said the man with a puzzled frown. - I mean that I made an excuse\nand left early.\nHe collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and brie\ufb02y.\nOn that one occasion, they discovered from him the following:\nWhen it became clear that Prak could not be stopped, that here was truth\nin its absolute and \ufb01nal form, the court was cleared.\nNot only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it. Steel walls were\nerected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, electric fences,\ncrocodile swamps and three major armies were installed, so that no one would\never have to hear Prak speak.\n- That\u2019s a pity, - said Arthur. - I\u2019d like to hear what he had to say. Pre-\nsumably he would know what the Ultimate Question to the Ultimate Answer\nis. It\u2019s always bothered me that we never found out.\n- Think of a number, - said the computer, - any number.\nArthur told the computer the telephone number of King\u2019s Cross railway\nstation passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have some function,\nand this might turn out to be it.\nThe computer injected the number into the ship\u2019s reconstituted Improbabil-\nity Drive.\nIn Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells Matter how\nto move.\nThe Heart of Gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself neatly within\nthe inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber of Law.\nThe courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly designed\nfor Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You wouldn\u2019t hold a dinner\nparty here - at least, not a successful one. The decor would get your guests\ndown.\nThe ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark. Shadows lurked there with\ngrim determination. The panelling for the walls and benches, the cladding of\nthe heavy pillars, all were carved from the darkest and most severe trees in\nthe fearsome Forest of Arglebard. The massive black Podium of Justice which\ndominated the centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam\nhad ever managed to slink this far into the Justice complex of Argabuthon it\nwould have turned around and slunk straight back out again.\nArthur and Trillian were the \ufb01rst in, whilst Ford and Zaphod bravely kept\na watch on their rear.\nAt \ufb01rst it seemed totally dark and deserted. their footsteps echoed hollowly\nround the chamber. This seemed curious. All the defences were still in position\nand operative around the outside of the building, they had run scan checks.\nTherefore, they had assumed, the truth-telling must still be going on.\nBut there was nothing.\nThen, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they spotted a dull\nred glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow. They swung a torch", "663b66f5-cea8-4406-b5d9-58e2dca6f46e": "144 CHAPTER 32.\nround on to it.\nPrak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette.\n- Hi, - he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed through the chamber.\nHe was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with his shoulders hunched forward\nand his head and knees kept jiggling. He took a drag of his cigarette.\nThey stared at him.\n- What\u2019s going on? - said Trillian.\n- Nothing, - said the man and jiggled his shoulders.\nArthur shone his torch full on Prak\u2019s face.\n- We thought, - he said, - that you were meant to be telling the Truth, the\nWhole Truth and Nothing but the Truth.\n- Oh, that, - said Prak. - Yeah. I was. I \ufb01nished. There\u2019s not nearly as\nmuch of it as people imagine. Some of it\u2019s pretty funny, though.\nHe suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter and stopped\nagain. he sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He dragged on his cigarette\nwith a strange half-smile.\nFord and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows.\n- Tell us about it, - said Ford.\n- Oh, I can\u2019t remember any of it now, - said Prak. - I thought of writing\nsome of it down, but \ufb01rst I couldn\u2019t \ufb01nd a pencil, and then I thought, why\nbother?\nThere was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel the\nUniverse age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight.\n- None of it? - said Arthur at last. - You can remember none of it?\n- No. Except most of the good bits were about frogs, I remember that.\nSuddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet on the\nground.\n- You would not believe some of the things about frogs, - he gasped. - Come\non let\u2019s go and \ufb01nd ourselves a frog. Boy, will I ever see them in a new light!\n- He leapt to his feet and did a tiny little dance. Then he stopped and took a\nlong drag at his cigarette.\n- Let\u2019s \ufb01nd a frog I can laugh at, - he said simply. - Anyway, who are you\nguys?\n- We came to \ufb01nd you, - said Trillian, deliberately not keeping the disap-\npointment out of her voice. - My name is Trillian.\nPrak jiggled his head.\n- Ford Prefect, - said Ford Prefect with a shrug.\nPrak jiggled his head.\n- And I, - said Zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once again deep\nenough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly, - am\nZaphod Beeblebrox.\nPrak jiggled his head.\n- Who\u2019s this guy? - said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was\nstanding silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts.\n- Me? - said Arthur. - Oh, my name\u2019s Arthur Dent.\nPrak\u2019s eyes popped out of his head.\n- No kidding? - he yelped. - You are Arthur Dent?

He fell over backwards on to the\nbench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with laughter, he kicked\nhis legs in the air, he beat his chest. Gradually he subsided, panting. He\nlooked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell back again howling with laughter.\nEventually he fell asleep.\nArthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried Prak\ncomatose on to the ship.\n- Before we picked up Prak, - said Arthur, - I was going to leave. I still want\nto, and I think I should do so as soon as possible.\nThe others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly undermined\nby the heavily mu\ufb04ed and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came\ndrifting from Prak\u2019s cabin at the farthest end of the ship.\n- We have questioned him, - continued Arthur, - or at least, you have ques-\ntioned him - I, as you know, can\u2019t go near him - on everything, and he doesn\u2019t\nreally seem to have anything to contribute. Just the occasional snippet, and\nthings I don\u2019t want to hear about frogs.\nThe others tried not to smirk.\n- Now, I am the \ufb01rst to appreciate a joke, - said Arthur and then had to\nwait for the others to stop laughing.\n- I am the \ufb01rst... - he stopped again. This time he stopped and listened to\nthe silence. There actually was silence this time, and it had come very suddenly.\nPrak was quiet. For days they had lived with constant manical laughter ring-\ning round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling\nand sleep. Arthur\u2019s very soul was clenched with paranoia.\nThis was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at a board\ntold them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak.\n- He\u2019s not well, - said Trillian quietly. - The constant laughing is completely\nwrecking his body.\nArthur\u2019s lips twitched but he said nothing.\n- We\u2019d better go and see him, - said Trillian.\nTrillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face.\n- He wants you to go in, - she said to Arthur, who was wearing his glum\nand tight-lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his dressing-gown pockets\nand tried to think of something to say which wouldn\u2019t sound petty. It seemed\nterribly unfair, but he couldn\u2019t.\n- Please, - said Trillian.\nHe shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face with him,\ndespite the reaction this always provoked from Prak.\nHe looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, ashen\nand wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and Zaphod were standing\nby the bed looking awkward.\n- You wanted to ask me something, - said Prak in a thin voice and coughed\nslightly.\nJust the cough made Arthur sti\ufb00en, but it passed and subsided.\n- How do you know that? - he asked.\nPrak shrugged weakly.\n- \u2019Cos it\u2019s true, - he said simply.\nArthur took the point.", "d23fea16-ce6e-4d2c-8f3c-6905db2a5cb5": "146 CHAPTER 32.\n- Yes, - he said at last in rather a strained drawl. - I did have a question. Or\nrather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted to know what the Question\nwas.\nPrak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little.\n- It\u2019s... well, it\u2019s a long story, - he said, - but the Question I would like to\nknow is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. All we\nknow is that the Answer is Forty-Two, which is a little aggravating.\nPrak nodded again.\n- Forty-Two, - he said. - Yes, that\u2019s right.\nHe paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like the shadows\nof clouds crossing the land.\n- I\u2019m afraid, - he said at last, - that the Question and the Answer are mutually\nexclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other. It is\nimpossible that both can ever be known about the same universe.\nHe paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur\u2019s face and snuggled\ndown into its accustomed place.\n- Except, - said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, - if it happened, it\nseems that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each other out and\ntake the Universe with them, which would then be replaced by something even\nmore bizarrely inexplicable. It is possible that this has already happened, - he\nadded with a weak smile, - but there is a certain amount of Uncertainty about\nit.\nA little giggle brushed through him.\nArthur sat down on a stool.\n- Oh well, - he said with resignation, - I was just hoping there would be some\nsort of reason.\n- Do you know, - said Prak, - the story of the Reason?\nArthur said that he didn\u2019t, and Prak said that he knew that he didn\u2019t.\nHe told it.\nOne night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet which had\nnever seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the ship was this one. It\nappeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens.\nPrimitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold Hillsides looked up\nfrom their steaming night-drinks and pointed with trembling \ufb01ngers, swearing\nthat they had seen a sign, a sign from their gods which meant that they must\nnow arise at last and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains.\nIn the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains looked up and\nsaw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that\nthey must now go and set about the accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides.\nAnd between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the sky and\nsaw the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and apprehension, for though\nthey had never seen anything like it before, they too knew precisely what it\nforeshadowed, and they bowed their heads in despair.\nThey knew that when the rains came, it was a sign.\nWhen the rains departed, it was a sign.\nWhen the winds rose, it was a sign.\nWhen the winds fell, it was a sign.\nWhen in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat with\nthree heads, that was a sign.", "82d9077a-2feb-40bb-8132-02f5c71edc5b": "147\nWhen in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a perfectly\nnormal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even just a child with a\nretrousse nose, that too would often be taken as a sign.\nSo there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of a\nparticularly spectacular order.\nAnd each new sign signi\ufb01ed the same thing - that the Princes of the Plains\nand the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat the hell out of each\nother again.\nThis in itself wouldn\u2019t be so bad, except that the Princes of the Plains and\nthe Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each\nother in the Forest, and it was always the Dwellers in the Forest who came o\ufb00\nworst in these exchanges, though as far as they could see it never had anything\nto do with them.\nAnd sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the Dwellers in\nthe Forest would send a messenger to either the leader of the Princes of the\nPlains or the leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know\nthe reason for this intolerable behaviour.\nAnd the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger aside and\nexplain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully and with great attention to the\nconsiderable detail involved.\nAnd the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was very clear, very\nrational, and tough. The messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish\nthat he had not realized what a tough and complex place the real world was,\nand what di\ufb03culties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it.\n- Now do you understand? - the leader would say.\nThe messenger would nod dumbly.\n- And you see these battles have to take place?\nAnother dumb nod.\n- And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is in everybody\u2019s\nbest interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that they should?\n- Er...\n- In the long run.\n- Er, yes.\nAnd the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to his people\nin the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked through the Forest and\namongst the trees, he found that all he could remember of the Reason was\nhow terribly clear the argument had seemed. What it actually was he couldn\u2019t\nremember at all.\nAnd this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen and the\nPrinces came hacking and burning their way through the Forest, killing every\nForest Dweller in their way.\nPrak paused in his story and coughed pathetically.\n- I was the messenger, - he said, - after the battles precipitated by the\nappearance of your ship, which were particularly savage. Many of our people\ndied. I thought I could bring the Reason back. I went and was told it by the\nleader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my\nmind like snow in the sun. That was many years ago, and much has happened\nsince then.\nHe looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently.", "e64edb25-fa33-4d90-9235-a87a5f85a7df": "148 CHAPTER 32.\n- There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug. Apart from\nthe frogs, and that is God\u2019s last message to his creation. Would you like to hear\nit?\nFor a moment they didn\u2019t know whether to take him seriously.\n- \u2019Strue, - he said. - For real. I mean it.\nHis chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. His head lolled slightly.\n- I wasn\u2019t very impressed with it when I \ufb01rst knew what it was, - he said, -\nbut now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince\u2019s Reason, and how\nsoon afterwards I couldn\u2019t recall it at all, I think it might be a lot more helpful.\nWould you like to know what it is? Would you?\nThey nodded dumbly.\n- I bet you would. If you\u2019re that interested I suggest you go and look for it.\nIt is written in thirty-foot-high letters of \ufb01re on top of the Quentulus Quazgar\nMountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out\nfrom the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma. It is guarded by\nthe Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob.\nThere was a long silence following this announcement, which was \ufb01nally\nbroken by Arthur.\n- Sorry, it\u2019s where? - he said.\n- It is written, - repeated Prak, - in thirty-foot-high letters of \ufb01re on top of\nthe Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet\nPreliumtarn, third out from the...\n- Sorry, - said Arthur again, - which mountains?\n- The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the\nplanet...\n- Which land was that? I didn\u2019t quite catch it.\n- Sevorbeupstry, on the planet...\n- Sevorbe-what?\n- Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, - said Prak and died testily.\nIn the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, but in the\nend he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it, and\ninsisted on following his original plan of \ufb01nding a nice little world somewhere\nto settle down and lead a quiet retired life. Having saved the Universe twice in\none day he thought that he could take things a little easier from now on.\nThey dropped him o\ufb00 on the planet Krikkit, which was now once again an\nidyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves.\nHe spent a lot of time \ufb02ying.\nHe learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversation\nwas fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind speed, wing spans, power-\nto-weight ratios and a fair bit about berries. Unfortunately, he discovered, once\nyou have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it\nthe whole time, just inane bird chatter. There is no getting away from it.\nFor that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on\nthe ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there\nas well.\nOne day, he was walking through the \ufb01elds humming a ravishing tune he\u2019d\nheard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in\nfront of him.\nA hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey-green alien marched\nout and approached him.", "70430ef0-2d61-4b32-ac06-4b74ded64149": "149\n- Arthur Phili... - it said, then glanced sharply at him and down at his\nclipboard.
