","This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind.

","In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timoth√©e Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver.",/review/rw9648338/?ref_=tt_urv

","Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her.

The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year?

","Dune: Part Two: Sand, Sand, and more effing Sand! There is a certain Monty Phytonesque touch to Dune: Part Two. Paul insists he;s not the Messiah yet we get a scene straight out of Life of Brian with a gaggle of Fremen giggling as they proclaim him as the Messiah. This is a serious issue though; Chani (Zendaya) and other young Fremen reject the idea of a Messiah as something that holds them back and oppose the more conservative people. Chani still admire Paul though and their relationship flourishes as the narrative unfolds. Lady Jessica (Rebecca Fergusson) becomes Reverend Mother of the Fremen, surviving a grueling, deadly ritual. She heads south to win over the Fundamentalist Fremen to Paul's cause as the Messiah. The Emperor Christopher Walken) also casts a beady eye on Arrakis, his daughter, Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) however is very much a creature of the Bene Gesserit. The Harkonnens continue to oppress the Fremen but the failure of Glisssu Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) to inflict a telling defeat lead to his replacement by Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), Baron Vladimir Harkonnen's (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) youngest nephew and heir (""na-Baron"") to House Harkonnen.

","I just watched the pre-premiere of part two of Dune. It was a very good adaption of the books but not what totally what I expected. At the end the movie strayed away from the book which made me a bit sad to be honest. Especially the part (which is very important in the book-storyline) is the fact that the sister of Paul wasn't born yet when the film came to it's conclusion. Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end. Part one definitely did follow the book... part two also till the midst of the film.

","This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timoth√©e Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.",/review/rw9644114/?ref_=tt_urv

Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in ""part two"". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases.

","I still remember where I was when the first Dune movie was announced. Now, after all these years, I'm even more excited for what's to come. Before watching the movie, I read many praising articles and reviews, but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it. Dune Part Two delivers exactly what it promises - a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written. It's a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most pure-hearted leaders to descend into chaos. The film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the Harkonnens and the Fremen's insane harmonization with their planet. The Fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer. The investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on. Denis Villeneuve has done it again and this time, he has hit a home run. Collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation, Greig Fraser, Denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema. It not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself. With its skillful use of practical sets, lighting, and digitized effects, this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker. Although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive, they do not distract from its main focus, which is the storytelling. The film follows a love story that defies all odds, as Paul assumes the role of the Messiah, Chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well. In the first act, Paul's character undergoes significant changes. He tries to distance himself from his mother's actions by joining the Fremen's cause to liberate their planet from tyranny. However, he remains unaware that Jessica's plan is already in progress. Despite this, the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments. The empire is in a state of despair as the Fremen successfully destroy the Harkonnen spice reserves one by one. This has pushed the Bene Gesserit to their limits, and as a result, the Baron has deployed his most valuable weapon, Feyd Rautha. The second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable. And to top it all off, Denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence. In the end, Paul finally realizes what he has to do. He takes the Water of Life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause, but proceeds anyway. By doing so, he loses his one true love, yet he stands his ground in an incredible hand-to-hand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an Emperor. Once again, Hans Zimmer's astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories. I highly recommend watching this film in 70mm IMAX print, if possible.",/review/rw9663244/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dune: Part Two is the perfect example of a movie that must be seen in the cinema and not at home. The visual spectacle and design is unparalleled among sci-fi and really feels like a completely fleshed out future world (or worlds), with architecture, props and costumes that look like they were sourced from a museum rather than a Hollywood warehouse. Compared to the first film, the stakes have true gravity and the scope is much wider with far-ranging battles and conspiracies. It's hard to pinpoint any highlight as every scene is iconic, incredibly beautiful to behold and accompanied by expertly rousing music, all underscoring the central feeling of foreboding. Where would I begin? The ceremonies with the Water of Life plunge us into an ancient ritual that almost kills the drinker and reveals deep secrets that the audience only finds out in drips. Paul's terrifying vision of death and destruction (much less cheesy than in the first film) show the inner turmoil he faces as someone who is the fulcrum of the planet's destiny and resents his role but can't escape the fate set in motion by higher powers. The short scenes with the foetus are mysterious and tease at an important role to be played by her future version. Chani's frantic misgivings in the Fremen gatherings impress the deleterious effects the prophecies are having on her people and the unprecedented role of the Bene Gessarit. Princess Irulan's musings in a beautiful garden about the historical developments around her uncover just how deeply all the conspiracies extend. The scenes in the Harkonnen's world are stark and show how brutal and power-hungry they are and how formidable they can be. The actors in these scenes are perfectly cast and all impart a sense of heaviness, as if to stress just how much Spice is tied to the fate of the world, the past and the future all together. All of this combines to form an experience that immerses us in a compelling future conflict, relentlessly ratchets up in tension and constantly giving the sense that there's something even more world-shattering just around the corner.",/review/rw9660795/?ref_=tt_urv

Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing ""special"" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for ""best sci fi film of all time"" to until my last days as a film watcher.

","I read the first 3 Dune books about 15 years ago, I was a pretty big Dune dork back in the day, but then my interest waned and life got in the way. So I'd say my POV is somewhere between a mega Dune fan, and the general audience who doesn't know anything about the books. Zoom forward to 2021 and though I was excited for Part 1, I wasn't blown away by it (though I must admit I've enjoyed Part 1 more and more each time I've watched it). I went into Part 2 more curious than excited, but my gosh was I surprised by how much I enjoyed it!! I was running a little late to my showtime, and didn't get a chance to use the restroom before. I kept waiting for a ""slow"" or boring scene to sneak out--and that scene never came. Every moment felt important, and each scene held my attention so completely, that I decided the discomfort of needing to void wasn't worth missing a beat. So I guess it's rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before, but learn from my mistakes! Dune Part 2 is mesmerizing, beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. It's been a really long time since I've had such a visceral reaction to a movie; I kept thinking to myself, ""the movies are back!!""

","This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¬æ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timoth√©e Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsg√•rd) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones.

","Dune Part Two is the sequel to the first Dune film by director Denis Villeneuve, which was released in 2021. Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) has now joined the Fremen group. Here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms. Paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. With Chani (Zendaya) at his side, Paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the Emperor (Christopher Walken). This sequel, three years later, immediately picks up where the first part ended. This first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the Dune story. Previous film adaptations turned out less well, because the story of the Dune books is quite a large and complicated story. With Denis Villeneuve's first part he managed to properly introduce the Dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups. With this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the Fremen group, who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach. Furthermore, the relationship between Paul and Chani is also developed a bit more, but there are some rushed moments. However, with this second part, many things have to be explained and built upon, which means that there are some long-winded moments in this second part. Compared to the first part, this second part has more room for action scenes, which increases the pace and tension slightly. Furthermore, it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses, which fight each other more strategically than really physically. In contrast to the first part, things in this second part feel more rushed. Like the relationship between Paul and Chani. The aspect of the earthworms and how the Fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner, so it is not always clear. Denis Villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the Dune books. Together with photography director Greig Fraser, they ensure that the images appear beautiful, creative and credible. By adapting the Dune story from the first book of the series into two films, Denis Villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation. This also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films. Timoth√©e Chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family. Furthermore, he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance. Compared to the first part, Zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with Timoth√©e Chalamet, his character. However, this relationship can seem a bit rushed, which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer. Of the new cast members, Austin Butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army, but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development. Other well-known actors such as Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken play their roles well and appropriately, but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second Dune film.",/review/rw9656167/?ref_=tt_urv

The scenery was breathtaking and in regards to acting it was clear the actors have embraced and portrayed their characters to √† T in direct correlation to the novel they are portrayed in the most perfect way. I admit I was weary before watching because the first one was just incredible .. but this does not dissapoint, I can only think of 2 other movies in history where the sequel outshined or performed on the same level of the first part and that would either be T2 jugement day,and of course the godfather 2. These titles are renowned and beloved by all, and quite Frankly that's the direction The Dune Saga has broughtforth, your left glued to the scream and asking what? I'm gonna have to wait another 3 years ... what if I don't live that long... Even if you haven't seen the first film, one can pick up and follow along as long as they pay attention to the narrative and direction the film is going in. Because the final showdown does not dissapoint and as I said prior.. Why do I have to wait another 3 years and here I am writing my commentary before healing to work and buying another ticket to see it on the big screen again this evening. Dune delivers in the opposition direction of every failed sequel and just leaves you in awe as the cr√©dits come on screen as your left in disbelief that 3 hours has just passed.

It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges.

At the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that I felt were important in establishing the overall story, however after watching the second part I understand what Denis Villeneuve's vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction. The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience. I'm sad to see the whole story arc of Thufir Hawat as well as Paul's child and his bizarre sister being dropped, but I understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things aren't as necessary/needed to build for future installments.

","I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here. A big thank you to AMC Theatres and WB for the opportunity to experience this in IMAX tonight. I highly recommend a premium format because the immersive sound truly enhances the viewing experience.

The musical score intensifies every scene and whilst it could have been paced better, what with a slow-ish start and a seemingly compacted final act, I was entertained throughout.",/review/rw9653609/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Dune: Part Two"" has all the elements to make the amazing cinema experience. When you watch this film, you can really dig into the world, feel it, almost touch it, could I say. It have all of the things we need, tragedy, action, and of course a little bit of humor from time to time. The first film (Dune: Part One) was definitely an overrated average film that I can't say I enjoyed to much. It didn't felt complete, had many lacks and unfinished details in the story, and the action was generally speaking really boring. Now the sequel, was on a way different level, and it's really rare to say that a sequel is better than the original, but in this case it is true. The plot goes straight after the first one, continuing the battle for the injustice of this dark and cruel world. New characters, enemies, secrets to be revealed, and everything has to end with one word: War. I can start to say how much this film feels like reality. In Dune, the people dealing with the problems on their planets, feels exactly how the wars, revolutions and aspects humanity had over centuries. This film couldn't show it any better. Including some real prophecy stuff involved here, I almost felt Timoth√©e Chalamet was the walking Jesus talking for the good, besides that Jesus didn't master martial arts or any fighting technics of some sortüôÇ The character development was also a strong part of the plot, and the characters felt much more important to me that before. The first hour of ""Dune: Part Two"" were Paul Atreides was teached the way of being a Fremen (The Desert People) felt almost to me like ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" when the forest people had to learn from the water people to survive in the new place. I felt the reference was strong here, but not if it was a bad thing, of course. Now jumping over to the technicals and camera, that I think carried a big part of the film, really the atmosphere. The camera filming, usage of the shadows and light, as well as the very interesting angles, smooth montage, and epic editing with the amazing music score, couldn't have made it more of a cinematic experience. They had some very interesting ideas of showing things, for example a baby inside a mother's stomach, and such graphic illusion of that I have never seen before. The runtime was good, and I didn't really felt bored, I was entertained all the time, and I can't wait to see the sequel: ""Dune: Part Three"", that will debut after some years. So concluding, yes, you should watch this, it was much better than the first one, and it is an experience you are going to remember!",/review/rw9652642/?ref_=tt_urv

","I would say that my expectations going into the movie were somewhat high. The book is highly loved and I enjoyed the first movie greatly. And yet, it blew my mind. One of my first thoughts coming out of the theater was how it compared to empire strikes back. I mean could this have been better? Maybe. It certainly gave me more goosebumps. It was more visually stunning and had a soundtrack that while not as iconic, certainly feels more true to the atmosphere of the movie. It had been a long time since a sci-fi made me forget I was watching a movie. The movie has three strengths: the beginning, the middle, and the end. Although the beginning and end were definitely my favorite. Now I'm just crying thinking about waiting for part three.",/review/rw9655108/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hello again film friends, I hope you are all well. So Dune part two is finally here, and the one question I'm sure you're all asking is, well those of you that havent seen it yet anyway, does it live up to the hype? And let me answer with a very strong YES! It is a beautiful epic in every sense, the acting, the story, the images and of course the music. Everyone involved really brought their A-game and knew they were making something special. The story this time is much more evolved and even more enticing than part one. No spoilers here but if you enjoyed part one then you owe it to yourself to see the epic next chapter. There are so many exciting beautiful images in this story that my friends and I were grinning from ear to ear pretty much all the way through. I'm very happy for director Dennis Villenueve as his last beautiful epic Blade runner 2049 was VERY under appreciated and overlooked, but he is getting the recognition for his genius now at least with Dune. I will warm fans of the book tho that some things have been changed but the good news is that it doesn't spoil ANY of your enjoyment of this rendition of the story. There isn't really much else I can say at this point without giving away even the smallest of spoilers, I will redo my review once the bluray is in my greedy hands! Quick note, those of you that have a 3D set up you can actually buy part one in 3D!!! It was released in Germany I think and looks amazing in 3D! So anyway I'll wrap it up with advising you go and see this as soon as possible and also recommend seeing it in IMAX for the best experience possible! Thanks for reading and until the next time, stay safe and may the force be with you.",/review/rw9662373/?ref_=tt_urv

You really see him grow into this character the Lisan Al-Gaib. There were a few acting performances that did not hit par but on the whole, this is a mega movie and a true box-office beast.

The Godfather 2 of Dune.. Even better than the first. What struck me so often in this film was though the Dune Novels was the inspiration for so many Syfy stories, novels, films you would expect some amount of.. ""oh I have seen that before"" but in Villeneuve's hands, he delivers originality. I expect the film will do to Films what the Books originally did. Its a master class. It there is any thing to criticize, is the jumps in the story from time to time... But it doesnt matter...because the blanks get filled in. Just like a torture scene or love scene where, not everything is shown... Ur imagination is allowed to do the rest. As for Hans Zimmer's score. Oscar in the bag.

","Back in 2021, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, HBO Max (now known as simply Max) released Denis Villeneuve's adaption of ""Dune"" the same day that it was released theatrically. So, I decided to sit down on my couch and give it a watch. Perhaps influenced by the horrendous streaming experience - with constant freezes, bufferings, and drops in quality - I didn't much enjoy ""Dune."" Cut to March 1, 2024. I planned on seeing ""Dune: Part Two"" in theatres. Before doing so, in order to refresh my (alcohol-influenced and shockingly poor) recollection, I decided to watch 2021's ""Dune"" again, this time on 4k Blu-Ray. And even though the viewing experience was far better than the one I had watching it many years ago on HBO Max, to my surprise, my opinion remained the same - ""Dune,"" to me, was a visually stunning but emotionally hollow and surprisingly cold feeling film. Its lack of characterization and flimsy script didn't allow me to invest in the characters as much as I found myself investing in the world building. However, with ""Dune: Part Two"" on the horizon, I suspended my judgement until I was able to see the complete story that Villeneuve wanted to tell.

The certain thing is that the part two doesnt disappoint in any section, I thing that only improves and when I mean improve I dont say in technical terms but the viewer appreciate even more the scenario the characters every spectrum of the film.

","(spoilers) Have been waiting awhile (over 2 years actually like everyone else) for director Villeneuve's continuation with Dune 2 and was not disappointed. 'Dune 2' is a formidable and at times spectacular cinema. I will say I liked its predecessor's pacing better than this one whose finale seemed a bit anti-climactic and off kilter. The stylized visuals give way to a cramped and dark-lit final set that seemed like a stage play oddly a bit out of place from some earlier beautiful, and intricate set designs.. Catching this on IMAX though was certainly worthwhile though. Javier Bardem fills in for the life and energy of the movie somewhat similar to Jason Momoa in the earlier film. Easily the best scene of the movie for me was the earlier fight scene with Harkonnen harvester, ground troops and Paul and Chani in serious battle , the fight choreography and melding of visual affects and sound was absoluately stunning and 1st rate putting even the Empire Strikes Back Hoth effects to shame. Was overall pleased with this entry and looking forward to Villeneuve's next picture, hopefully Science Fiction. Got the feelling more Dune will be on the way - looking forward to it.

","Initially, the film attacks the goals of the top of the filmography with the quality of the scenes, the set, the costumes and also working with the atmosphere. The actors are convincing and the environment, even if generated in places, is incorporated so that it is almost imperceptible. However, where the film's problem arises is in the dramaturgy. Working with film time is not goot at all. The movie sequences don't always fit together, and the closer we get to the end, the more problems there are in this area. In some places, the tension is cut off, and then the tension is missing and the logic of the characters' actions begins to hide. The worst thing is exactly the feeling of watching a movie. It's great that the film captures and hits, but it can't sustain interest all the time without problems. Just the fact that the viewer asks what time it is and how long it takes in the cinema, he notices the people around him and has to literally struggle to keep watching. When the real world starts talking to him through the illusion of the screen. That's a failure. As the film moves forward and nears the end, it becomes boring. The dramaturgy and the position of the characters in the story, their value for the story completely collapses towards the end and is saved only by the vision of a possible sequel.
