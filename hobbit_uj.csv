0,26 January 2013,bob the moo,," A visual feast but yet I wasn't gripped by the story or characters as much as I should have been
","When I heard that there was to be a film version of The Hobbit, I was quite looking forward to it as the big finish of Lord of the Rings was still in my mind and, unlike LotR, I had actually read The Hobbit several times many years ago. When I heard that it might be two films I wasn't surprised but the news that it was to be three did rather dampen my spirits as I don't know if I had the interest for this story to be concluded as 2016 rolls into town. Regardless I did of course watch the film because it is still a large blockbuster and, at a time of the year normally filled with overly earnest Oscar contenders, I did quite like the idea of returning to this world again.",/review/rw2743686/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" quite a few times now. I like it a lot. The first few times I watched it I found it hit and miss. The movie still takes a couple of dips here and there but those parts don't bother me as much as they used to. Now the only demerit I give this movie has to do with its length. It's a about twenty minutes too long. Otherwise, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a very exciting and emotional ride. It's also a great looking movie with very good music.

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) is a movie I originally saw in theaters, is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture involves our old friend, Bilbo Baggins, as a youth when Gandalf the wizard shows up at his door about an adventure. Bilbo says no but that night 12 dwarfs show up at his door and tells him a story about a dragon that stole their homeland and gold. They would like to return home, regain their kingdom and need Bilbo's help to make that happen. Bilbo will try to say no, but we all know he can't.",/review/rw8573450/?ref_=tt_urv

The story is fun and interesting. Most of the film's protagonists were fun and watching Gandalf bring back memories of The Lord of the Rings.

He invites Bilbo on an adventure but he declines; the next day thirteen Dwarfs turn up at Bilbo's home believing that they have been invited. They tell him of their quest but he initially refuses; he has no desire to leave home.

An elderly Bilbo Baggins writes to Frodo about the land of Erebor, where the Dwarf King Thror lost his land and prosperity to the dragon Smaug. Bilbo then recalls the earlier years of his life (played by Martin Freeman), where he's timid and lost his sense of adventure. Bilbo's complacency is questioned by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who secretly arranges for a meeting to be held in the hobbit's house. One evening Bilbo is interrupted by thirteen dwarfs who invite themselves inside. He's told these dwarfs are in search of a home but need a burglar who can accompany them to the mountain where Smaug is and take back their land and treasure. Initially reluctant, Bilbo trails after the unit but this does little to impress Thorin (Richard Armitage), the dwarf leader and grandson of Thror, who doubts the hobbit's commitment.

When the An Unexpected Journey was ready for release it was announced that its running time came to 168 minutes .

","The Lord of the Rings has been a timeless epic classic that is hard for other fantasy, Tolkien wannabe movies to capture its magic and so far, director Peter Jackson is probably the only one who can capture it. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of a split trilogy of its prequel. Though, J.R.R. Tolkien's book is not really that long for a split and the film is even a lot longer as the story's introduction. The result of the movie is it's rather too long and a bit slow but the experience is still worth it. With its spectacular visuals and grand scale, it's all pretty exciting.

The CG animation of trolls was almost as ugly as in the Lord of the Rings. The only reason of making it 3D was making me cope with the uncomfortably of 3D. The dwarf parcour and scenes copied from the Lord of the Rings (compare the fight of Thorin and Azog with that of Isildur and Sauron), artificially added action-scenes and castrated non-action scenes spoke of lazy, commercial, mainstream work.

The Hobbit as a book is great, an exciting and very well-written one with identifiable character, though the story is noticeably more slight than Lord of the Rings. Seeing it in the cinema as a whole family and with friends, every single one of us left the film with smiles on our faces, expectations met.

The Hobbit is a movie prequel to The Lord of the Rings, dealing with Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who was tricked into having a party at his abode. Earlier, a dwarf king rules a mountain until a dragon takes the gold the king has hoarded. That act cost him his life. Though Bilbo was very reluctant at first, he comes to aid when the Mountain Trolls steal the ponies, then capture the army for their dinner. Bilbo stalled them long enough for Galdolf the Grey (Ian McKellan) makes his move by cracking some light on the trolls: they fear bright light. Then they encounter the cave where they find the treasure and some weaponry in which Bilbo gets a sword for himself. This sword has a blue glow to it. Then after the separation of him and the dwarfs he encounter Gollum, a hobbit who was corrupted by a ring. Bilbo took it from him while he was eating the goblin. Following the battle, Bilbo proved his worth. This prequel has a very good meaning to it. Tolkien works will remember many things for years to come.

This has something to do with keeping the ""Fanboys"" in line. We don't want to be dictated to by people who are really involved in these kinds of movies. This seems juvenile and dishonest. If we weren't so jaded by the ability to produce special effects beyond our previous imaginations, would we be so cynical. The story is the story. The characters are the characters. Don't criticize Bilbo because he went on the quest, betraying his comfort level. That's what happened in the story. If you want to be critical, look at the elements of film making. I agree that the beginning is quite slow. It takes way too long to get things running. But once they begin the quest, they begin to face off with some incredibly amazing adversaries. If you read the book, you don't see a lot of character development. Gandalf and Bilbo are interesting, but it is in the classic tradition of courtly love. We don't really get to know the Knights of the Round Table either because it is their feats that are the thing of legend. They have a quest and they face off against the unknown, armed only with legend. The result is a series of amazing tasks going to the nth degree.

The way the movie starts is very clever, and the whole introduction before the journey is almost exactly like the book, which I enjoyed very much. The fights scenes, just exactly as LOTR are INCREDIBLE,very well done, and with some funny moments as well. The cast is flawless, I think every actor portrays their character to perfection, I was happy with all the acting choices.

Since then, Jackson has only had a couple of directing gigs, including his lackluster remake of the classic ""King Kong."" And only one piece of the LOTR saga remains for him to tap into. Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"" isn't just a prequel chronologically. Tolkien actually wrote and published it almost twenty years before what would be considered the first book of the LOTR trilogy. While the books in the trilogy were epic fantasies that dug deep into the lore, the prequel was a light-hearted romp, a first footstep into a Middle Earth still taking shape in Tolkien's imagination. It was also a short romp, only a fraction of the length of any of the sequels. So, while fans clamored for the Extended Cuts of Jackson's original trilogy a decade ago, eating up the scenes that couldn't make it into the three-hour theatrical cuts, there's not much excuse to turn ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy of its own.",/review/rw2721120/?ref_=tt_urv

","Long before he took the helm of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, New Zealand born Peter Jackson had acquired both a name and a reputation for himself as an independent splatter-gore horror movie maestro.

Repellent in some respects but brilliant in others with the brilliant winning out over the repellent summarizes these films. The squeamish should shun them. ""Bad Taste"" lives up to its title, while ""Meet the Feebles"" teeters on puppet porn with scenes that anticipated the 2004 gross-out fest ""Team America: World Police."" Jackson went mainstream with ""Heavenly Creatures"" (1984) starring Kate Winslet of ""Titanic"" fame. Later, in 1996, he put ""Back to the Future"" lead Michael J. Fox through the paces in his supernatural chiller ""The Frighteners."" These two are both worth renting if you've never watched them. Ultimately, Jackson ascended into the pantheon of movie directors with the ""Rings"" trilogy. Sadly, his creative star plunged with his dreadful ""King Kong"" remake and the lackluster but sympathetic crime thriller ""The Lonely Bones.""

","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy—the much awaited prequel series to the ubiquitously acclaimed The Lord of the Rings Trilogy—based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, or There and Back Again. The trilogy's second and the third installments viz. ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" and ""The Hobbit: There and Back Again"" are scheduled to release in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey presents the first part of the quest undertaken by an artless hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and a band of vagrant dwarfs to help the latter reclaim their lost kingdom from the clutches of a fiendish dragon named Smaug. During the course of the journey Bilbo and company must always remain wary of the dangers lurking in the shadowy avenues of the Middle-earth.

","This movie was really disappointing. Let me say that although I didn't read the LOTR books, I loved the movies. However, I did read The Hobbit. Just got back from the theaters a few hours ago so I've had a few hours to think about what I liked and didn't like. First off, one hour into the movie I found myself getting sleepy and closing my eyes for a few minutes (I have never done that). I thought, ""maybe Im just exhausted from Christmas"" but after the movie my Mom, cousins and uncle all said they did the same thing! We actually got a little laugh about it as it was the only reason we could find to smile after seeing the movie. It just took too long for ""the adventure"" to get started, and there was little reason to understand WHY Bilbo changed his mind and decided to go! Second, Im done with IMAX,3D movies that are set in dark locations like this movie. Its physically too hard to follow the action and I find myself exhausted trying to keep up with ""whos getting killed"" or ""who lived"". Speaking of getting killed, NOBODY DID! About half way through the adventure it just started to get ridiculous how these puny dwarfs were surviving everything they were going through. I know its a fantasy movie, but gimmie a break! By the end I knew everyone was going to live through everything, making the battle scenes very boring. Bilbo had to be the most disappointing character in this movie. The book was written through his eyes and it made you sympathize with his struggles. I had ZERO sympathy for Bilbo! I almost feel guilty saying that as I almost cried watching the cartoon when I was a kid! Lastly,(and I might be the only person who didn't know this going in) when the movie ended I got a real sickening felling deep inside. The Hobbit was ONE short book! Why are they trying to make it into 3 very long movies!! All of a sudden I realized I had been duped. Duped into a typical Hollywood money-grab riding on the coat-tails of LOTR. At that point I realized why this movie was so bad. Its just trying to be something it is not. If this movie was made as a one movie blockbuster it would have been great. John Carter could have done the same thing but instead, the writers put all the books into one movie and it turned out great. This is the exact opposite. Parts 2 and 3 of this story will be seen by me at the dollar theater.

Some even call it ""the new Phantom of Menace""... Really!? The movie has it's flaws, but that is just plain silly. Rather than trying to top the previous three films in every way possible, Jackson tells an entirely different story. The plot does somewhat resemble the previous, but it's all taken from the book so you can't pick down on that! Much from the book has made it into the film, and you can easily work out what it was! We've already come to know and love most of the characters in this movie, so it's much easier to relate to the movie at once! The character development is still there, and I think we will get more in the extended edition! ",/review/rw2722581/?ref_=tt_urv

The whole trilogy is a collective success that is one of the few cinematic achievements that I would ever consider as perfect. Flash forward to the present day, and we now take a trip back to Middle Earth with The Hobbit, the prequel to the trilogy.

Unlike Lord Of The Rings that is actually 3 books and makes sense to be 3 movies, Hobbit is a very short book. A good one. But short. Should have stuck to that and would have been amazing.

Massive shifting of characters from believable to unrecognisable seems to be the norm here .One boring action set piece after another ,actual plot is something you don't even dare dream about. hard to believe this is the man that fans demanded to direct the films i think even Michael bay would have been a better choice and more faithful to the source material.

","I was intrigued--yet concerned--to see producer Peter Jackson resurrecting the same cast of characters some ten years later to work on The Hobbit. I was even more concerned to behold that Jackson intended to stretch The Hobbit out to three overlong films, particularly since Tolkien's original work measures a scant 200 pages or so, compared to 1100+ pages for ""Lord of the Rings."" My concern was borne out when I suffered through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Why does Bilbo not even meet Gollum--an episode that occurs early in the book--until the picture is three-fourths over? (Answer: Jackson had to inject umpteen largely irrelevant tales from Tolkien's ""Silmarillion"" to flesh out the picture, combined with rather unimpressive CGI animation (folks, we've seen it all before.) Where is the reasonably exciting, certainly entertaining, episode where the dwarfs are captured by the giant spiders? (Answer: I guess we have to wait until the sequel--or even the threequel.)

Of course, being that these novels are among the most loved and revered ever written, I know that this is simply my own take on them.

Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings (LotR)"" novel trilogy and Peter Jackson's movie trilogy based on it: I haven't done the LotR ""reading homework"" (yet, but I'd like to someday), so how can I presume to watch and fully appreciate and understand the LotR movies?

And I don't remember Radagast having bird dung running down the side of his head in the book. I also felt that the over-the-top gross depiction of the orc king was not in keeping with the book. I think that Mr. Jackson missed the mark with this movie. The book was ""fun"", for me the movie wasn't.
