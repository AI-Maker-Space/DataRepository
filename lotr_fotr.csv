","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.",/review/rw1308663/?ref_=tt_urv
1,11 November 2014,adamscastlevania2,10," Thank you Mr Jackson
","(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.",/review/rw3121701/?ref_=tt_urv

","An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath.

All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done.

","I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others.

It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.

I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind .

","The sheer feeling of excitement I got while watching this movie was something I thought I would never get a chance to experience. Not really being an avid reader of Tolkien's works, I feel that (and this might seem like heresy to some people) watching this not only allows you to understand the huge Lord of the Rings universe more clearly, but also see it in all its stunning imagery and scenery. After all, this wasn't possible until this movie came out. There are so many incredible things about this movie that I don't even know where to start, and because it's still so recent, I was surprised by (but still aware of the fact) that it's often said to be one of the best films ever. Like always, I'll start by explaining the storyline, which perfectly sets up and establishes a vibrant fantasy world like no other. Fellowship of the Ring starts by telling us that in Middle-earth's second age, the lords ruling over the races of humans, dwarves, and elves have special rings given to them. They are all incredibly powerful, but the dark lord Sauron forges a ring of his own in his evil kingdom of Mordor. This ring (known as the One Ring), has a large portion of his own malevolent energy sealed into it. Sauron wants to eventually take all the other rings for himself and invade middle-earth. Eventually, a huge army of men and elves fight Sauron's army in Mordor, and he is defeated by a warrior named Isildur. Isildur has the opportunity to throw the One Ring into the flames of Mount Doom, which is the only place that can destroy it, but chooses not to. Although Sauron is defeated (for now), his ring still has a huge amount of power. It is lost at the bottom of a river for 25 centuries until a creature named Smeagol locates it. It corrupts him and turns him into monster. One day, Smeagol loses it and it's found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who has no idea of the tragic history of the item he now possesses. 6 decades have passed since Bilbo has found the ring. On his 111th birthday, he is visited by his old wizard friend, Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen). Gandalf tries to convince Bilbo to give up the ring because of its evil history, so he leaves on a quest and allows his nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) to have access to all his belongs (including the ring). Meanwhile, Gandalf finds out that Smeagol was captured by Sauron's forces and tortured until he revealed the ring's location. He only told them that Bilbo had it, and that he lived in The Shire, but this was enough. Faceless horse riders dressed in black cloaks, known as Ringwraiths, scour Bilbo's neighborhood looking for the ring, so Gandalf and Frodo both leave. Gandalf travels to the fortress of Isengard to meet with the wise wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) to discuss what to do next, but the latter is actually allied with Sauron and traps Gandolf inside the structure. Frodo soldiers on. He takes some of his friends, Sam, Pippin and Merry, and arrives at a village called Bree. They're supposed to meet Gandalf here, but because he's been taken prisoner, he never shows up. After journeying a bit more with the assistance of a new ally named Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the group are ambushed by Ringwraiths and Frodo is stabbed with one of their weapons, which has the power to turn him into one after a few hours. Aragorn's elf girlfriend, named Arwen, saves Frodo while being chased by ringwraiths, and gets rid of them by inducing a flood with her magic. Frodo is eventually healed, and Gandalf has managed to escape Saruman's clutches using a giant bird. While everyone sits around trying to decide what to do next, the newly established Fellowship of the Ring intends to destroy the ring by taking it to Mordor. On the way there, they try to scale a snowy mountain, but Saruman is aware of their efforts and tries to cause an avalanche. Frodo decides it's too dangerous and tells everyone they need to travel through the Mines of Moria instead, which isn't much better. While there, they fight numerous Orcs, a savage and warlike race who were once elves, as well as a huge troll. Sadly, Gandalf is apparently killed when he fends off an enormous demon called a Balrog so the others can escape unharmed. Finally, the group arrives at Lothlorien, an elf realm ruled by the queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). Here, Frodo learns from a vision that only he can take the ring to Mordor and destroy it. In one last attempt to take the ring back, Saruman raises an enormous orc army and sends it to the Kingdom of Gondor. Two warriors assigned to protect Frodo, Boromir and Legolas (Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom respectively) try their best to fend off the relentless stream of orcs, but Baromir is killed. Frodo and Sam then travel down a mountain pass. With Mordor in sight, Frodo knows what he must do. The quality of this movie blows my mind. Normally I'm reluctant to give movies made past the 1970s perfect scores, because to be honest few of them deserve it. With this one, it makes me realize that maybe watching a recent movie now and then is a good idea. There's so many reasons to praise this movie that I can do it all day long, but for me, it's three things: the incredibly rich and detailed environments, the compelling characters, and the engrossing story. I'm sure it's a well known fact that Lord of the Rings as a whole served to inspire countless other fantasy movies, books, and even video games, and it's not hard to imagine why. Tolkien's universe is ridiculously big, and contains a large number of kingdoms, realms, and countless other locations, each with their own unique backstories and histories. It doesn't take anything less than a masterpiece of a book to inspire a film of this caliber. The landscapes in this movie are just something to behold, and it's my firm belief that basically every single frame of it belongs in a museum. All the environments look different, but they're all incredibly dreamlike and captivating to stare at. I can do it for hours. The characters are the meat of the story, and LOTR doesn't disappoint in any way. Although Sauron doesn't appear much physically, you can feel his presence throughout the film because the ring has his life essence in it, and wants to find its way back to him. Throughout the entire movie, Frodo is carrying with him immense amounts of evil. I think we can all agree that Gandalf is one of the greatest characters in fictional history anyway, whether you're a fan of this series or not. The special effects too are definitely worthy of such a monumental series. Even 20 years later, they look amazing and just as real as the actors themselves, which can't be said for a lot of other modern films. There's so much more to the movie though that I've barely touched the surface. It's not like no one knows this, since Tolkien's books have been considered classics for decades for good reason. It just amazes me that Peter Jackson was able to create such a worthy adaptation of a book people have loved for years. The most mindblowing thing is that there's more than one, but that's a story for another time.",/review/rw8499111/?ref_=tt_urv

","Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever (""Star Wars"" has lost its edge, and ""The Matrix"" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well.

","I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).",/review/rw0457691/?ref_=tt_urv

I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why.

In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant.

","For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.",/review/rw1146354/?ref_=tt_urv

","Peter Jackson adores DVD. He knew going in to his daring translation of Tolkien's fantasy that it wouldn't stop at the cinema. The idea of a finished film can be fluid: scenes excised for valid reasons can be reinstated for home consumption. So, for DVD, not a 'director's cut' replacing the theatrical version, but an alternative extended edit. Put back into the film seamlessly, the extra half-hour of footage doesn't denigrate the original cut, but enhances it like an encore. The tone and story don't change; the journey is deepened, even if the momentum slows. Book-devotees especially will delight in the re-inclusion of Bilbo's voiceover on bucolic Hobbit culture, the extension of Aragorn's backstory, and the small additions on the other members of the Fellowship. If any section feels improved, it is Lothlorien with Cate Blanchett's Galadriel: here we get the famous gift-giving sequence which will prove significant, in the films to come, while the thematic weight of the Elvish decline grows more prominent. Nothing is lost and plenty is gained - this Special Extended Edition DVD is precious indeed. ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but the Hobbits themselves have been pushed off center stage. If the books are about brave little creatures who enlist powerful men and wizards to help them in a dangerous crusade, the movie is about powerful men and wizards who embark on a dangerous crusade, and take along the Hobbits. That is not true of every scene or episode, but by the end ""Fellowship"" adds up to more of a sword and sorcery epic than a realization of the more naive and guileless vision of J. R. R. Tolkien. The film is remarkably well made. But it does go on, and on, and on--more vistas, more forests, more sounds in the night, more fearsome creatures, more prophecies, more visions, more dire warnings, more close calls, until we realize this sort of thing can continue indefinitely. ""This tale grew in the telling,"" Tolkien tells us in the famous first words of his foreword; it's as if Tolkien, and now Jackson, grew so fond of the journey, they dreaded the destination. Jackson has used modern special effects to great purpose in several shots, especially one where a massive wall of water forms and reforms into the wraiths of charging stallions.

","J. R. R. Tolkien changed literature with his trilogy The Lord of the Rings. A new genre was created practically from nothing. Owing much to fairy tales and epics of old, yet still being something new, fantasy soon captured the imaginations of generation after another. The Lords of the Rings was written as a myth, as an epic, a tale about the struggle against ancient, undying evil. In it great warrior kings and armies of legend fought for the control of Middle-Earth against armies of darkness, filled with hordes of orcs, goblins and trolls. Yet it was a small, insignificant being, a hobbit from the Shire, that would decide their fate through his deeds.",/review/rw3316803/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud.",/review/rw2811606/?ref_=tt_urv

","I consider The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring not only the best LOTR movie but the best film of all time. The movie has much better cohesion from the sequels. It also has a far more organized screenplay. The story begins with two heroes, who later became four, then five, then nine and then the journey begins. The dangers are so many you need to hold your breath. There are deadly mountains, thunders, the mines of Moria, a place that has been held by the enemy, monsters, a sword-wielding fire demon called Balrog, Galadriel the Argonath, the death of some members and the break of the fellowship. I like that the heroes are all together instead of the sequels who are seperated. Also the movie has the greatest leitmotif in cinema's history. Every character, place and race has a theme of it's own. You hardly grasp the importance of music in film. It's an invisible layer of pure emotion that guides us or challenge us, or guides or challenges the drama itself. One other thing that this movie has and the other two don't is Sean Bean's character, Boromir which I find the most intresting character of the trilogy. His character in the end finds redemption and in my eyes it's the most heroic death I have ever seen. The ending is heartbreaking and it's surely one to remember. The movie's shooting began in 1999 and the CGI are better from movies like The Hobbit trilogy which is made almost 15 years later. That proves that practical effects are better that computers. It's been 20 years since 2001 and this trilogy has age perfectly.

147,3 January 2002,supertom-3,10," Best film I have seen!!, and I've seen some greats!
","As a fan of fantasy films since my child hood I have eagerly awaited this film since I first heard it was being released, I remember being read the books when I was younger and being enthralled although I remember nothing from them. Fantasy films have sets and costumes that build magical worlds that the audience can be lost in but of all of them bar Star wars, none have been exceptional and all flawed in some way. I like the sword and sorcery slant more than anything else but have never had a film that nowadays I could look at critically and call excellent. My favourite film of all time is Masters of the Universe, no other film filled me with such excitement as that did, but it is majorlly floored, other favourites include Legend a film that visually was breathtaking but that was about all it was. Anyway this is the complete article. Visually this is the greatest film ever from the sets, effects down to the amazing and groundbreaking effects. Some of the flowing camera movements are vertigo inducingly brilliant, an example could be the opening battle scene as the camera sweeps through hordes of battling soldiers falling off cliffs or bludgeoning each other as the camera takes us through the battle fields. Peter Jackson's direction is dynamic and at times breathtakingly brilliant. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end throughout this film, I was lost in middle earth for three hours thanks to Jackson's mastery, his imagination obviously running rampant in the designing of the characters, worlds etc based on nothing more than descriptive story telling and perhaps a few odd sketches. I am glad I decided not to bring in any popcorn or sparkling beverage as an unwelcome need to go pee-pee may have resulted in me wetting myself and the fellow viewers either side of me parting like the red sea from the subsequent whiff. Apart from the amazing visuals the films story is imaginative and engaging but what do you expect from a classic fictional epic like Tolkiens Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Jackson as far as I know has stayed faithful to the story but of course needing to cut down a few moments of the piece and of course these will go noticed by some to varying degrees of noticability because of course everyone has their own ideas of what parts of a book they have read is important compared to somebody else's opinion. What is great about Tolkiens world, and characters is they are universally compatible, you don't need to have read the books to fully enjoy this, its easy enough to pick up, good versus evil and we get an opening story telling about the rings creation as well as other things of importance. The actors are all well cast here, and all of them perform excellently. Elijah Wood is very good in the lead; he manages to hold the film together in such a big role where others may have lost it to the supporting cast. Ian Mckellan is also brilliant as the wizard Gandalf and others who impress are Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, and a very good Sean Bean in a key role and all the others in this film performed to a level bettering anything I have seen them in. Worthy of note are the two main females the gorgeous Cate Blanchett as the wise and at times scary elf queen, and the impossibly attractive Liv Tyler who must surely have silenced unfair criticism with this performance, she is exceptional in this. She is sexy, tough, gentle and she steals the screen whenever she is on it, simply said she looks hot! One person I have not yet mentioned is Viggo Mortensen who plays Aragon; he for me was narrowly the star of the film. Viggo makes an excellent action hero in this and his performance is outstanding, I genuinely believe he is worthy of Oscar consideration for this film. The only minor fault of the film I would say is the end, because being only a third of the story of course there is no conclusion so it ends all so suddenly. Like pulling a bottle of milk from a baby's mouth when he was only half done I felt mildly annoyed and desperate to see part two, and considering I have to wait a year, I became equally desperate to watch the film again. I do feel that a whole year is a lengthy time to wait and I can see it as nothing more than a marketing ploy to build demand and expectation for the sequel. Anyway Christmas time has once again become an exciting time for me thanks to the Lord of the rings trilogy. Also excellent about this film would have to be the ear poundingly good sound effects, they were astounding. This added to the feeling of the film and like for instance Gladiator this film is one you just have to see on the big screen. I give this a definite 10/10 and it is number one in my mind. What excites me the most is that the sequels are supposed to get better and better. Bring on number 2.",/review/rw0458182/?ref_=tt_urv

This year's academy competition for my guess will be Lord of the Rings vs. A Beautiful Mind.  One of the nominees for both movies, which most of you know, is the best director award. Though I have not seen A Beautiful Mind, I would like to say that Peter Jackson should win for two main reasons. 1. He's a director that has not done a lot of movies and he has just created a masterpiece. And 2. Since he's a director who hasn't done many movies, it's very hard to make a movie that's going to be nominated for best picture which he has accomplished, but it's even harder for a a rookie director to make a masterpiece that is based on a book. Yeah Ron Howard is real good director, but many people aren't capable of making a masterpiece movie based on a masterpiece book trilogy.

209,16 April 2002,nekkosduredro,10," Breathtaking! What a Wonderful Film! **Warning! **Spoilers!**
","Having now seen the film 17 (!) times at the cinema, and written 3 previous imdb user comments, I think it is time to write one final praise of its qualities. My earlier comments have been written without me preparing a script, so I have done that this time. Let me start at the beginning of the film. Galadriel (unseen) starts the opening narration (the world is changed.....) and at this time, no matter how many times I see it, I start gasping for air, and I feel like the film becomes part of me. No film has ever had this effect on me before, without anything really happening, and I can´t explain it. Then the ""Theme of the Ring"" plays over the films title, and it is so sad, yet beautiful, that it wonderfully prepares you for a tragic and sad story that will be enlivened by humour. Then follows a short retelling of the forging of the Rings of Power, with the unforgettably sad image of the nine kings who will ""return"" as the Nazgul. And the amazing battle-scene at the foot of Mount Doom, in which the ring comes to Isuldur. He is then ambushed and killed, and the scene where he floats dead in the Anduin brings tears to my eyes no matter how many times I see it. This says a lot about Peter Jacksons achievement: Despite that he has made a film laden with SFX, he has managed to bring back to (big-budget-)movies something basic that has been lost since Star Wars or so: To make a film really affect your emotions! All right, perhaps it hasn´t been entirely lost, but I have never experienced it to this effect. And the ring comes to Gollum, E.T.s bad twin brother, I saw the 20-year edition last Saturday, and that creature had the same fingers, very similar head and body, and a scene in which he stares into the camera the same way as Gollum in Moria, and humans saying (repeatedly)""he (E.T.) came to me."" Then follows the first appearance of Frodo, then Gandalf, and their wonderful first exchange (A wizard is never late....) and the magnificent ride through Hobbiton, with fireworks, Gandalf, and the wonderful first frowning, then laughing, then stared into frowning again old woman, who, in a simple way captures the spirit of the hobbit. Actually, I myself grew up in a hobbit-like family in al rural area, and that is perhaps why I like the film so much. In fact, the old woman and her daughter? reminded me of my grandmother and my aunt (her daughter), but enough of that.... Then of course, there is Bilbo. Because the book is so widely read, his disappearance at his own birthday party, and the Ring making him (slightly) aggressive, could easily have been trite on film. But because of Peter Jacksons brilliant direction, and Ian Holms spot-on performance, it comes across as entirely fresh. My favourite moment is when he accuses Gandalf of wanting the ring, Gandalf uses his powers and Bilbo falls into his arms like a child. I´m not going to retell the entire film here, but let´s take the first appearance of Aragorn/Strider. He is a mysterious stranger sitting in the corner of an inn, staring at Frodo. This must be one of the oldest clichès in the book, but Peter Jackson actually makes it mystifying and exciting without too many effects. In the end, I must give praise to Peter Jackson for making a film that has the same effect on me as it´s title-object has on it´s former bearers: It draws me to it.

I mean, if that's not one hell of an adventure, I'm not sure what is. And still the movie doesn't feel like it has too much things going on.

From one who has read the books, I have to say it stayed very true to them.  A few omissions were made, but they were necessary to keep the movie down to three hours.  Now onto the good stuff. Casting was excellent.  I can't think of a better person to play Frodo than Elijah Wood, nor a better person to play Gandalf than Ian McKellan.  The other hobbits were played very well, and notable performances were given by Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom.  Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler played their parts very well, too.  The landscapes, shot in New Zealand, were simply breathtaking.  The Shire and Bilbo's house were just as I imagined them.  The background music complimented the action very well, and the visual effects, especially the Balrog, were stunning.

","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is easily one of the most ambitious films ever made. The sheer scope of the film is enough to warrant a viewing from any moviegoer. Never before has the combination of CGI and live action footage been as superfluous as it was in this movie (this goes for all of the other films in the trilogy as well). Though what makes this film distinguished from the other two Lord of the Rings films is that this is the setup for all that is to come, so there is a certain level of mystery and intrigue to each action set piece. I think it is that intrigue that sets this one apart from the rest of the trilogy. When you view Two Towers and Return of the King, they are very similar in tone and style, but this one had a more different approach than those two, and this is also by and large because this one focuses more so on nine characters than entire nations as a whole. Another key difference between this one and the other two is that the action taking place in this film is more like a Golden Age adventure film in style, where as the action in the other two is modeled to be like epic war sagas.",/review/rw2037248/?ref_=tt_urv
233,14 January 2005,sol-,4," ""it has some interesting elements""
","A spectacular-looking fantasy adventure with the feel of an epic, but yet missing too much to truly rate as an epic. The cinematography is breathtaking (albeit it actually mostly computer generated), the makeup is admirable and some of the set design is really good, but yet in terms of screenplay it ultimately dull. Converting the first part of 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy novel into a film seemed to be an impossible feat at the time of the film's production, as the books were full of so many essential details that they would not be satisfying without all the content. Nevertheless the producers went ahead, trimming things here and there, creating overall a good-looking film but one in which the events are unclear and the plot is too convoluted to be understood by anyone not familiar with Tolkein's novel. The concept of character developed is abandoned in the epic swoop of the film, creating a not very involving watch. The film is very lengthy, which should not be a problem in the best of epics, but in this one it just leaves a bad taste, as there is no reason to care what actually happens. The film indeed brews a tendency to bore at times, and the action sequences are not only mindless, but are too violent for younger audiences, which is a shame as the 'The Lord of the Rings' is excellent for enthusiastic young readers. On the other hand, there are a number of positives to the film, as it is technically interesting, but that is not enough to make it a very good watch  at the most it is an above average film, because it has some interesting elements. It is just a shame that the cinematic virtues of the film were not given more justice by the screenplay. The original cut was 270 minutes, and judged on the overkill length of this version, two parts to the film would have perhaps worked better. Or perhaps Tolkein's novels would have been better untouched by live action film.",/review/rw0999224/?ref_=tt_urv
