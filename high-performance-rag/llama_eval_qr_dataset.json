        "fcece494-2ad7-4902-81af-6e3794eff2c4": "The study conducted by I. Covelo et al. observed differences in the variables when comparing AFF (Autologous Follicular Fluid) at 22 hours and 26 hours, and WFF (Whole Follicular Fluid) at 22 hours and 26 hours. The variables in question were the total oocytes, cumulus expansion, maturation rate, and fertilization rate. \n\nWhen comparing AFF at 22 hours and 26 hours, differences were detected in all variables. Similarly, when comparing WFF at 22 hours and 26 hours, differences were also detected in all variables. However, when comparing AFF at 22 hours with WFF at 22 hours, no differences were detected in any of the variables. But when comparing AFF at 26 hours with WFF at 26 hours, differences were detected in all variables.\n\nThese comparisons suggest that the duration of exposure (22 hours vs 26 hours) significantly impacts the variables in both AFF and WFF. However, at the same duration of 22 hours, AFF and WFF do not show any significant differences. The differences become apparent when the duration is increased to 26 hours. This could imply that the type of follicular fluid (AFF vs WFF) and the duration of exposure interact in a complex way to influence oocyte development and maturation.",
        "87ba4d41-f307-46b6-957f-519db85cdaae": "The document mentions that the collection of oocytes from slaughterhouse ovaries or live animals allows for the recovery and utilization of non-ovulatory follicles. The factors that affect the collection of ovaries include the method and instruments used for collection, the training of the operator, and the quality and origin of the ovaries. \n\nThe suitability of oocytes per ovary is directly associated with three variables: ovary collection and transport, the methods and instruments used to obtain the oocytes, and the correct selection criteria. Therefore, the training of the operator and the quality and origin of the ovaries are important factors in evaluating results.\n\nIn terms of oocyte maturation, in vitro maturation systems must ensure that the resulting oocyte completes the first reductional division and is capable of being fertilized, leading to a competent zygote that can continue its development after transfer. The document refers to a source that describes many aspects of oocyte maturation that should be considered during their cultivation, including nuclear maturation and the ability to be fertilized.",

They were different within the male and cria groups over time, but not the female group. Cholesterol concentrations were found to be different in the female group only between the first (2 weeks prepartum) and fifth (approximately 4 months in lactation) samples.",

Eumelanin and Pheomelanin are two types of pigments that determine the color of the wool. The presence of these pigments varies across different breeds. \n\nThe PTCA (Pyrrole-2,3,5 Tricarboxyic acid) is an indicator of eumelanin, while PTCNAHP (Aminohydroxyphenylalanin) is an indicator of pheomelanin. The PTCA and PTCNAHP ratio is used to determine the type of melanin present in the wool. \n\nIf the PTCA value is greater than 100 ng/mg and the PTCA/PTCNAHP ratio is greater than 1.0, the wool is considered to be eumelanic (E). If the AHP value is greater than 100 ng/mg and the PTCA/PTCNAHP ratio is less than 0.1, the wool is mainly pheomelanic (P). If either or both of PTCA and AHP are greater than 100 ng/mg and the PTCA/AHP ratio is between 0.1 to 1.0, the wool is of mixed type (M).\n\nThe table does not provide information on the pigmentation of goats and llamas. However, the context information mentions that llama samples are intensely pigmented with either eumelanin (black) or pheomelanin (red brown).",

The use of follicular fluid resulted in a higher percentage of oocytes maturing and being fertilized compared to those without follicular fluid. The fertilization rate was maintained at a higher level at 26 hours with added follicular fluid, but decreased without it.",

However, there is no data on its use in llamas. In the given study, the effectiveness of the epsilon toxoid in preventing enterotoxemia in llamas was measured by vaccinating different groups of llamas with a commercial vaccine against enterotoxemia. The llamas were divided into four groups: unvaccinated controls, vaccinated once on day 0, vaccinated twice on days 0 and 21, and vaccinated three times on days 0, 21 and 42.

        "ea02fd19-af65-4b99-8b36-467f0356ade5": "The study suspected that the majority of the alpacas were vitamin E deficient due to their hay diet, which lacked fresh forage. Once forage is cut, dried, and packaged as hay, the vitamin E concentration rapidly decreases within days below nutritional requirements. The potential solution to address this deficiency could be to provide the alpacas with additional supplementation. Another possibility could be to reevaluate the normal reference intervals for vitamin E concentrations in this species.",
        "3194fe20-05f1-4fe7-9e32-814f4cdb9ef5": "The study found that serum cholesterol results were surprising when comparing the cria (young alpacas) and the adult alpaca groups. The cholesterol concentrations were clinically stable over time for the adult male alpacas. For adult female alpacas, a larger variation in serum cholesterol was expected as they transitioned into lactation, based on observations in lactating dairy cows. This was due to an expected increase in metabolic demand leading to fat mobilization. However, only a mild change in cholesterol occurred, and due to the small sample size, it was unclear if this change was physiologically significant. \n\nIn contrast, after week 4 of age, crias were observed to have an increase in mean serum cholesterol concentration that remained significantly elevated compared to the female and male serum cholesterol concentrations. This was linked to previous studies in llamas and alpacas that have revealed an increase in milk fat composition occurring at 4 weeks of lactation and continuing through week 27.",
