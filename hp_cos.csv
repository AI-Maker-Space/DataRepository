0,20 June 2003,Doylenf,," Darker fantasy than the first Potter film...brisk despite its length...
","Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.",/review/rw0832982/?ref_=tt_urv
1,17 May 2003,ivony,9," A wonderful journey into a world where magic is, indeed, real.
","Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out:  buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them.  I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be ""butchered"" like most ""books to movies"" are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively ""stick to the book"" script it displayed.  Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.",/review/rw0832970/?ref_=tt_urv
2,21 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Somehow manages to be funnier than the first!
","I really liked the first movie, and I think I like this one more. It's certainly both darker and funnier than the first. This time though, Ron gets the most laughs(""OK can we panic now?""). Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said ""It's filthy down here,"" the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron's parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died. This movie is fairly faithful to the source material, and manages to have a bit of humour too. All in all, a dark and funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2055567/?ref_=tt_urv
3,21 January 2006,siit,7," That bit of magic returns
","The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.",/review/rw1271149/?ref_=tt_urv

5,10 October 2009,hnt_dnl,10," The best Harry Potter film?
","Not originally a fan of this series (really, not interested), I've got to say that I now see the widespread appeal of these Harry Potter movies! I actually first saw GOBLET OF FIRE (2005) when it premiered on cable the year after it's release and liked it enough to want to start watching this series. Then when ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) came out 2 years later, I liked it, but it seemed to get really dark and serious more so than GoF and I really needed perspective in understanding the trajectory of these HP films. I went out and bought the 5-disc collection of SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZBAKAN, GOBLET OF FIRE, and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. It's apparent these films are purposefully getting darker as they move along, some staying very true to the source material, some taking liberties.",/review/rw2138973/?ref_=tt_urv
6,13 February 2007,ccthemovieman-1,8," Entertaining, And Ranks Somewhere In The Middle Of The HP Films
","I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I've seen now.",/review/rw1597924/?ref_=tt_urv
7,31 December 2008,Coventry,8," Child-friendly but definitely not childish!
","Nearly 8 years and 6 films later, this was only my very first acquaintance with the Harry Potter franchise. I obnoxiously considered myself not to be a part of the target audience (too old and anti-computer generated effects), even though the copious fantasy & horror ingredients always somewhat triggered my curiosity. I literally waited until this second installment in the series was programmed on national television and I was too lazy to switch the channel. It didn't take too long before I regretted having waited this long, as ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a vastly entertaining and impressively accomplished blockbuster. Obviously I can't compare it to anything else, as I haven't seen any of the other films and never even held one of J.K. Rowling's books in my hands, but you don't need comparison in order to know this is excellent fun to enjoy with a big pack of popcorn. According to most reviewing people around here, this second film is already a lot darker and more sinister than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and apparently the series gradually grew more mature. Me, I was already quite astounded with the amount and types of morbidity featuring in this. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is child-friendly, but definitely not childish. Of course there aren't any explicit death sequences shown on screen, but there's loads of creepy stuff (giant spiders, snake-monsters, spontaneously combusting birds, Â…) that I imagine can be quite nightmarish.

9,13 August 2007,funkyfry,6," OK, but I think for fans only
","""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is, unfortunately, not one of the best Harry Potter movies despite (or perhaps because of) sticking relatively closely to J.K. Rowling's original novel (IMHO one of the better in the series). Some parts feel overlong and others too short, and there are signs that director Chris Columbus was growing fatigued in his second (and final) entry in the series.",/review/rw1711679/?ref_=tt_urv
10,17 November 2002,chicamanticore,," I absolutely LOVED this movie
","This movie is way better than the first one, which everyone is saying because--let's face it--it's true. The three leads have grown into their characters, and their acting is loads better. I kept thinking during the first one, ""Aw, look at these cute little kids playing Harry, Ron and Hermione."" Now they ARE Harry, Ron and Hermione, though they still won't get any Oscar nods. All the new characters were absolutely wonderful. I was not disappointed at all with a single one, even Dobby. Now, I know a lot of people compare him to another CGI character, but he's not like that at all. I loved Dobby, even though when I saw him the trailers I thought I was going to hate him. Jason Isaacs as Malfoy was an absolute slime ball, and just so deliciously evil. Not bad looking, either, especially with his luscious long blonde hair. Bonnie Wright returned as Ginny Weasley, who had a much more important part and did an excellent job, I was very impressed. I'm tempted to go on about the lovely Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle, and Kenneth Branaugh, who embodies Gilderoy Lockhart on the screen, but this review has a word limit. Even if you are not a massive Harry Potter fan, you will find this movie very enjoyable. It's scary (spiders, snakes, and willows, oh my!) and incredibly funny, thanks to Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and of course Kenneth Branaugh, the incredibly pompous new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Back to the subject of the three leads, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione). They have grown quite a bit since the last film, though it's not a bad thing-Harry and his friends are supposed to grow too. Girls are starting to notice how good-looking Harry has become, and Ron, who is still adorable, and Hermione is becoming very pretty. I was pleased to see that her appearance was more like it was described in the books-she even had big teeth. Ron is finally taller than the other two like he's supposed to be, but that's most likely due to Rupert being older. I only had one disappointment as a major Potter fan-Sean Biggerstaff. While I believe he is absolutely dreamy and am in love with him, he just didn't come across as the mad, maniacal Wood we've grown to love. A consolation for some of the die-hard fans who might find the movie a little fast when they first see it-see it twice. The second time is so much more enjoyable, I can't tell you why, but you'll love it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, from the scary gothic kid who sits next to me in fourth period to my work-a-holic father, it's great. I can't wait to see it again with my mother, who was away this weekend. I've already seen it twice, and it's only been out for three days. I can guarantee that you'll enjoy it, even if you didn't like the first one-which I personally find odd, but slightly understandable. Slightly. Go see Chamber of Secrets!",/review/rw0832583/?ref_=tt_urv

","A superior sequel and a bonafide winner, this epic children's movie builds on last year's successful formula to offer a film that is even more satisfying than before. Boasting a bigger cast â€“ by retaining the same principal characters and introducing a handful of new ones â€“ better special effects and an intriguing storyline with just the right combination of humour, death, mystery and puzzles, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a delight to watch. Sure, there are problems too numerous to mention. The plot holes and events occurring which are inexplicable to those who haven't read the books are too numerous to mention. Still, at the end of the day, the primary market for this book is the child audience and almost every child should be enchanted by this film. After all, it's a make-believe fantasy in which good always triumphs over evil and the virtues of friendship, kindness, and nobility are promoted over all else, so what is there to complain about?

","Maybe it was keeping on Chris Columbus as director- he helmed the first Harry Potter and did an OK, if not that terrific, job at it- or in making it about as long as possible (whether or not everything in the book, as someone who's seen the films but not read the books, I can't say, though it feels like they crammed it all), or in making it a wee bit too corny, but Chamber of Secrets is a bulky kids movie. It has an appeal for the whole family, as does the first one, and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes, but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over (unless, of course, you're a hardcore fan). It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel: same characters that like Potter just as much- his closest friends Ron and Hermonie- and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy.

It's cool to see the main characters grow and develop in their roles, now in their second year at the Hogwarts School. If anything, this film has even more action and adventure than the first, though for youngsters it might require a bit of caution. There are some unusually harsh and brutal scenes here, like that aggressive tree the boys land in with the magical Weasley car, and the monstrous basilisk that Harry battles near the finale.

31,5 January 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6," A slight decrease in quality
","This film is the second entry in the hyper-successful Harry Potter franchise. In terms of box office, it became number 4 of the year 12 years ago. Like the first, it was directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""The Goonies"", ""Home Alone""), who did not return for film number 3, and written by Steve Kloves based on a Rowling novel. Kloves kept writing for all the films that followed afterward. Just like for Columbus, this was also the last performance for Richard Harris. The actor who portrayed Albus Dumbledore died not much later. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" included some creative inclusions of new characters and story lines, but it also fell flat on developing on some of the parts from the first film. Very early on we are introduced to Gobby, an interesting character and the Potter equivalent to Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"". You could almost say that this film has a message against racism with the victims here being Mudbloods. Fittingly, Malfoy's dad who is also new in the movie has an equally Arian look as his son. The Slytherin house is the one who is against letting Mudbloods (children with magic abilities from non-magic parents) into Hogwarts. At the one scene with the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (Kenneth Branagh, one of the more forgettable) and Snape I was wondering why they would support the Potter-Malfoy rivalry by letting them fight against each other. I don't expect good teachers to do that. This film is maybe the one that tells us most about the Malfoy dynasty, also about Hagrid and about the history of the different houses, well actually mostly about Slytherin. Too bad the other houses except that and Gryffindor are rarely mentioned. I bet they have some nice stories too.",/review/rw3155994/?ref_=tt_urv

Stories of witches and magic and supernatural powers and beings have cluttered literature since the days of Greek mythology, and people simply looked at it either as the remains of an ancient culture, a piece of art from a creative mind or a reminder of the many worlds out there which we know nothing about. In reading claims that the ""Harry Potter"" books and films open up the minds of children to magic, black or white and is a Pied Piper journey towards evil, I had to remind myself that as far as I can see, it's only a piece of fiction, that children have wild imaginations, and that as long as they are made aware that it is indeed, pure fiction, no evil can come from reading books or watching the films.

","This film essentially begins where its predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" left off with ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) leaving the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the summer. Naturally, since his only living relatives weren't very nice to him previously he dreads the thought of spending staying with them.

Then one day he gets a visit from a goblin named ""Dobby"" (voice supplied by Toby Jones) who also does everything he can to prevent him from going back as well-and the reason is more sinister than either of them realize. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this sequel was just as good as the movie before it due in large part to the darker and more intriguing plot.

Filled with spectacular detail of massive serpents, gigantic spiders, humungous trees, a flying car, and a bright orange bird of great significance. The Chamber of Secrets is somewhat a reference to Harry who inhabits an ability to understand a language spoken by snakes. Tragedy strikes when bodies are found frozen in shock. Witchcraft is not for children, but Harry conquers a massive foe using practical means. Solid plotting filled with wonder and surprise with director Chris Columbus returning to deliver greater magic. Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry whom must face this disturbing new ability plus face a greater monster. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson return as Ron and Hermione whom assist Harry in his quests. Kenneth Branaugh is a splendid new addition as a flamboyant teacher who presents magic from a situational standpoint but by and large he provides comic relief and a cowardly disposition.

Later, Harry finds a diary belonging to someone called Tom Riddle, and through this magical book he sees a vision about who may be responsible, Hagrid! Oh, and Harry also finds out he can talk Parceltongue, like a Slytherin student, which comes in handy when they go looking for the beast petrifying everyone, the Basilisk.

That is the nature of a film; much over two-and-a-half hours and the theatres are only going to be able to show a limited number of screenings, which will, of necessity, limit the profit to be made on the film--and the bottom line of any film project is ""How much of a profit will it make?"".

92,12 November 2002,phiggins,," Harry Potter and the Mansion of Tedium
","Just what is it about ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" that makes it so bland, so uninteresting?  I walked into the cinema on Friday night feeling a certain trepidation about the new HP film.  As one of the few remaining people on the planet who has never read an HP book, I wondered if spending the next two and a half hours in the company of Griffindellstumblebumhumblepiebumblebeepainintheass was really a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  It was not long before I had my answer.  No, it was not a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  As seemingly intelligent adults all around me cracked up at the hilarious antics of Valdemort and Fiddlededee and Sultanabran, I began to feel very uncomfortable indeed. Perhaps a pillow and a cup of cocoa would have helped.  Cinema seats are not designed for the sleepy.  To keep me awake, there staggered across the screen a succession of much-loved British character actors.  Oh, look, it's Julie Walters.  And that bloke from ""The Fast Show"".  And, oh, how lovely, it's cuddly Kenneth Branagh.  Marvellous.  Meanwhile our three heroes are proving, once and for all, that they cannot act.  The dolt who plays Harry has two expressions: ""I'm grinning"" and, ""I'm trying not to grin"".  The one who plays the other boy has one expression: ""I'm going to be sick"".  The girl has several, and is reasonably talented, but even she looks bored in this, and possibly very annoyed that she spends the second half of the film in a coma.  The plot, such as it is, can be summed up as follows: a succession of events occurs at the magical school of Hogwarts, or whatever the heck it's called.  HP sorts everything out.  The end.  The action (and I use the term very loosely indeed) is dull and plodding.  The special effects are bland and lifeless.  Each scene has no relation to the one before or after it.  The ""climax"", when it eventually arrives, is no more or less exciting than any other scene that has gone before it.  The entire film feels like it's been put together at random - some spiders here, a snake here, a flying car here, blah blah blah.  There is nothing magical or enchanting about this film.  It is dull and inane.  The only genuinely amusing moment comes when the boy who is not HP says, after the spider sequence, something along the lines of, ""What was the point of that, then?"" It's a very good question.  The scene (which probably cost twice as much as the whole of ""Monsoon Wedding"" or ""Ghost World"") has no reason to exist.  It serves no purpose.  It's not even scary. The entire film is two and a half hours of nothing at all.  And don't get me started on Quidditch.  As in HP1, the scene involving this pointless sport looks like it has come from an entirely different film.  The lighting is all wrong (being entirely computer-generated, this is not surprising, I suppose) and it jars with the rest of the movie. Two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back.  You'd think, after LOTR, TPM, AOTC and Spider bloody Man, that I'd have learned my lesson, wouldn't you?  Oh well.  If I can spare you the horror of this tedious drivel, then those two and a half hours will not have been totally wasted.",/review/rw0832448/?ref_=tt_urv
93,17 November 2002,MakoChan444@yahoo.com,10," Can you say Wonderful??
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a wonderful movie, just as good as the first. The acting I have to say was much better. Some parts were left out but it followed the book way more than the first one did. The actors that were choosen for this movie worked very well and Kenneth Branagh did a wonderful job as Gilderoy Lockhart. The only problem I had with it is that it was a little slow. It took awhile for somethings to get moving but that is alright. Everything just worked very well and the music was wonderful, just as good as the first. Over all I would give this movie an A+++ and for those who didn't like it (I don't tell people how to controll their opinions but...) your crazy. No it's ok not everyone has to like it. But I very much enjoyed it for being such an avid movie buff it was WONDERFUL!!",/review/rw0832585/?ref_=tt_urv
94,9 August 2009,barnabyrudge,4," Disappointing sequel with too many plot holes and a lot of indifference in the script and direction.
","It must be rather relaxing to be a writer, producer or director preparing a new Harry Potter film. Most films are a gamble â€“ will the audience respond enthusiastically? Will the film recoup its money? Will it pull in the crowds? But in the case of these films, there are none of those issues to worry about. The fan-base is so broad and so eager that people would walk through fire to see the films. In the case of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, the makers have too often been lazy because they're already guaranteed an audience. The film is uninspired and the script is totally by-the-numbers. It's a showy special effects movie that lacks real heart â€“ just a professionally executed exercise in commercial efficiency.",/review/rw2108887/?ref_=tt_urv

","I only watched this film last night, and i found it throughly enjoyable! Definitely a must-see film, and much better than the first. It was a lot funnier, not to mention scarier! As expected, there were a few let downs when some of the funniest or important scenes were left out. However, you have to realize not everything that sounds brilliant in the book can be just as good on the screen. Never-the-less.....i strongly recommend it!!!!

","Just finished the book again and go straight to watch the adaptation. It was amazing. I love how the book and movie go great together. The movie makes the book even much better. Like the movie completes the book. As in Dobby hiding in the cupboard. In the book, Dobby stood silent, but the movie makes it more tense. Also with the cake and everything.",/review/rw3439613/?ref_=tt_urv

I am not the biggest fan of the books, the movies. But I do have fun with them. And Harry Potter:And the Chamber of Secrets is for me the worst in the siries.",/review/rw9617338/?ref_=tt_urv
